To translate the contextual statements and the test statement into CVC5 Python formulas, we first need to represent the entities and their relationships in a suitable manner. We will define boolean variables for the necessary predicates and then translate each statement into its corresponding SMT formula.

Here is the parameterization for the given statements:

1. **Predicates**:
   - `chases(x, y)` : `x` chases `y`
   - `needs(x, y)`  : `x` needs `y`
   - `sees(x, y)`   : `x` sees `y`
   - `green(x)`     : `x` is green
   - `rough(x)`     : `x` is rough
   - `kind(x)`      : `x` is kind
   - `blue(x)`      : `x` is blue

2. **Entities**:
   - `bear`
   - `lion`
   - `tiger`
   - `cat`

Here's how you can define these relationships and translate each sentence into CVC5 Python formulas:

```python
import cvc5
solver = cvc5.Solver()

# Boolean sort
Bool = solver.getBooleanSort()

# Entities
bear = solver.mkConst(Bool, "bear")
lion = solver.mkConst(Bool, "lion")
tiger = solver.mkConst(Bool, "tiger")
cat = solver.mkConst(Bool, "cat")

# Predicates
chases = lambda x, y: solver.mkConst(Bool, f"chases({x},{y})")
needs = lambda x, y: solver.mkConst(Bool, f"needs({x},{y})")
sees = lambda x, y: solver.mkConst(Bool, f"sees({x},{y})")
green = lambda x: solver.mkConst(Bool, f"green({x})")
rough = lambda x: solver.mkConst(Bool, f"rough({x})")
kind = lambda x: solver.mkConst(Bool, f"kind({x})")
blue = lambda x: solver.mkConst(Bool, f"blue({x})")

# Setting up the contextual statements
context = []

# 1. If someone chases the bear then they need the lion.
context.append(solver.mkTerm(cvc5.kind.IMPLIES, 
                             chases('someone', 'bear'), 
                             needs('someone', 'lion')))

# 2. If someone chases the lion and the lion needs the cat then they chase the bear.
context.append(solver.mkTerm(cvc5.kind.IMPLIES, 
                             solver.mkTerm(cvc5.kind.AND, 
                                           chases('someone', 'lion'), 
                                           needs('lion', 'cat')), 
                             chases('someone', 'bear')))

# 3. If someone needs the tiger then the tiger sees the cat.
context.append(solver.mkTerm(cvc5.kind.IMPLIES, 
                             needs('someone', 'tiger'), 
                             sees('tiger', 'cat')))

# 4. If someone needs the cat then they see the cat.
context.append(solver.mkTerm(cvc5.kind.IMPLIES, 
                             needs('someone', 'cat'), 
                             sees('someone', 'cat')))

# 5. If the tiger is green then the tiger needs the cat.
context.append(solver.mkTerm(cvc5.kind.IMPLIES, 
                             green('tiger'), 
                             needs('tiger', 'cat')))

# 6. If someone needs the cat and the cat sees the lion then they are blue.
context.append(solver.mkTerm(cvc5.kind.IMPLIES, 
                             solver.mkTerm(cvc5.kind.AND, 
                                           needs('someone', 'cat'), 
                                           sees('cat', 'lion')), 
                             blue('someone')))

# 7. If the tiger sees the cat then the cat chases the bear.
context.append(solver.mkTerm(cvc5.kind.IMPLIES, 
                             sees('tiger', 'cat'), 
                             chases('cat', 'bear')))

# 8. If someone needs the lion and they chase the tiger then the lion needs the tiger.
context.append(solver.mkTerm(cvc5.kind.IMPLIES, 
                             solver.mkTerm(cvc5.kind.AND, 
                                           needs('someone', 'lion'), 
                                           chases('someone', 'tiger')), 
                             needs('lion', 'tiger')))

# 9. If someone needs the lion and the lion needs the tiger then the lion chases the cat.
context.append(solver.mkTerm(cvc5.kind.IMPLIES, 
                             solver.mkTerm(cvc5.kind.AND, 
                                           needs('someone', 'lion'), 
                                           needs('lion', 'tiger')), 
                             chases('lion', 'cat')))

# 10. The bear chases the tiger.
context.append(chases('bear', 'tiger'))

# 11. The bear needs the tiger.
context.append(needs('bear', 'tiger'))

# 12. The cat chases the tiger.
context.append(chases('cat', 'tiger'))

# 13. The cat is rough.
context.append(rough('cat'))

# 14. The lion is kind.
context.append(kind('lion'))

# 15. The lion sees the bear.
context.append(sees('lion', 'bear'))

# 16. The tiger chases the lion.
context.append(chases('tiger', 'lion'))

# Test statement
test_statement = solver.mkTerm(cvc5.kind.NOT, needs('cat', 'lion'))

# Add all contextual statements to the solver
for stmt in context:
    solver.assertFormula(stmt)

# Check if the test statement is satisfied or not
solver.push() # Save the current state -> Allows us to check multiple queries
solver.assertFormula(test_statement)

result = solver.checkSat()
print(f"Test statement is: {result}")

solver.pop() # Restore state before test statement

```

### Explanation:

Each contextual statement is translated into a CVC5 formula using `mkTerm` and the appropriate kind (e.g., `IMPLIES`, `AND`). The test statement is added to the solver, and the solver's result is printed to check whether the test statement is satisfied (`SATISFIABLE`) or unsatisfied (`UNSATISFIABLE`). This setup ensures the logic is correctly translated and evaluated by the CVC5 solver.
