['All smart people are cold.', 'If someone is red then they are rough.', 'All nice, red people are green.', 'All red, rough people are round.', 'If someone is rough and round then they are smart.', 'If Gary is smart and Gary is cold then Gary is nice.', 'Green, smart people are red.', 'Bob is cold.', 'Bob is green.', 'Bob is red.', 'Bob is round.', 'Fiona is green.', 'Fiona is smart.', 'Gary is green.', 'Gary is red.', 'Harry is green.', 'Harry is smart.']Gary is not cold.Sure! I will go through each statement, identify the parameters, and translate them into CVC5 Python formulas. After that, I will generate a test case to check the logic and syntax of the code.

First, let's import the necessary modules and initialize the solver:

```python
import cvc5

# Create a solver instance
solver = cvc5.Solver()

# Set the logic for the solver
solver.setLogic("QF_UF")

# Declaring the sorts (types)
Person = solver.getUninterpretedSort("Person")
Bool = solver.getBooleanSort()

# Declaring the predicates (functions)
smart = solver.declareFun("smart", [Person], Bool)
cold = solver.declareFun("cold", [Person], Bool)
red = solver.declareFun("red", [Person], Bool)
rough = solver.declareFun("rough", [Person], Bool)
nice = solver.declareFun("nice", [Person], Bool)
green = solver.declareFun("green", [Person], Bool)
round = solver.declareFun("round", [Person], Bool)
```

Now, let's translate each sentence into a CVC5 Python formula:

1. 'All smart people are cold.'

   ```python
   x = solver.mkVar(Person, "x")
   smart_implies_cold = solver.mkForall([x], solver.mkTerm(solver.Implies, solver.mkTerm(smart, x), solver.mkTerm(cold, x)))
   solver.assertFormula(smart_implies_cold)
   ```

2. 'If someone is red then they are rough.'

   ```python
   red_implies_rough = solver.mkForall([x], solver.mkTerm(solver.Implies, solver.mkTerm(red, x), solver.mkTerm(rough, x)))
   solver.assertFormula(red_implies_rough)
   ```

3. 'All nice, red people are green.'

   ```python
   nice_red_implies_green = solver.mkForall([x], solver.mkTerm(solver.Implies, solver.mkTerm(solver.And, solver.mkTerm(nice, x), solver.mkTerm(red, x)), solver.mkTerm(green, x)))
   solver.assertFormula(nice_red_implies_green)
   ```

4. 'All red, rough people are round.'

   ```python
   red_rough_implies_round = solver.mkForall([x], solver.mkTerm(solver.Implies, solver.mkTerm(solver.And, solver.mkTerm(red, x), solver.mkTerm(rough, x)), solver.mkTerm(round, x)))
   solver.assertFormula(red_rough_implies_round)
   ```

5. 'If someone is rough and round then they are smart.'

   ```python
   rough_round_implies_smart = solver.mkForall([x], solver.mkTerm(solver.Implies, solver.mkTerm(solver.And, solver.mkTerm(rough, x), solver.mkTerm(round, x)), solver.mkTerm(smart, x)))
   solver.assertFormula(rough_round_implies_smart)
   ```

6. 'If Gary is smart and Gary is cold then Gary is nice.'

   ```python
   Gary = solver.mkConst(Person, "Gary")
   gary_condition = solver.mkTerm(solver.And, solver.mkTerm(smart, Gary), solver.mkTerm(cold, Gary))
   gary_smart_cold_implies_nice = solver.mkTerm(solver.Implies, gary_condition, solver.mkTerm(nice, Gary))
   solver.assertFormula(gary_smart_cold_implies_nice)
   ```

7. 'Green, smart people are red.'

   ```python
   green_smart_implies_red = solver.mkForall([x], solver.mkTerm(solver.Implies, solver.mkTerm(solver.And, solver.mkTerm(green, x), solver.mkTerm(smart, x)), solver.mkTerm(red, x)))
   solver.assertFormula(green_smart_implies_red)
   ```

8. 'Bob is cold.'

   ```python
   Bob = solver.mkConst(Person, "Bob")
   bob_is_cold = solver.mkTerm(cold, Bob)
   solver.assertFormula(bob_is_cold)
   ```

9. 'Bob is green.'

   ```python
   bob_is_green = solver.mkTerm(green, Bob)
   solver.assertFormula(bob_is_green)
   ```

10. 'Bob is red.'

    ```python
    bob_is_red = solver.mkTerm(red, Bob)
    solver.assertFormula(bob_is_red)
    ```

11. 'Bob is round.'

    ```python
    bob_is_round = solver.mkTerm(round, Bob)
    solver.assertFormula(bob_is_round)
    ```

12. 'Fiona is green.'

    ```python
    Fiona = solver.mkConst(Person, "Fiona")
    fiona_is_green = solver.mkTerm(green, Fiona)
    solver.assertFormula(fiona_is_green)
    ```

13. 'Fiona is smart.'

    ```python
    fiona_is_smart = solver.mkTerm(smart, Fiona)
    solver.assertFormula(fiona_is_smart)
    ```

14. 'Gary is green.'

    ```python
    gary_is_green = solver.mkTerm(green, Gary)
    solver.assertFormula(gary_is_green)
    ```

15. 'Gary is red.'

    ```python
    gary_is_red = solver.mkTerm(red, Gary)
    solver.assertFormula(gary_is_red)
    ```

16. 'Harry is green.'

    ```python
    Harry = solver.mkConst(Person, "Harry")
    harry_is_green = solver.mkTerm(green, Harry)
    solver.assertFormula(harry_is_green)
    ```

17. 'Harry is smart.'

    ```python
    harry_is_smart = solver.mkTerm(smart, Harry)
    solver.assertFormula(harry_is_smart)
    ```

Finally, let's translate the test statement 'Gary is not cold.' and evaluate it:

```python
gary_not_cold = solver.mkTerm(solver.Not, solver.mkTerm(cold, Gary))

# Check if 'Gary is not cold.' satisfies the constraints
solver.assertFormula(gary_not_cold)

# Check for satisfiability
if solver.checkSat().isSat():
    print("The test statement 'Gary is not cold.' is satisfied.")
else:
    print("The test statement 'Gary is not cold.' is unsatisfied.")
```

Here's the complete CVC5 Python code:

```python
import cvc5

# Create a solver instance
solver = cvc5.Solver()

# Set the logic for the solver
solver.setLogic("QF_UF")

# Declaring the sorts (types)
Person = solver.getUninterpretedSort("Person")
Bool = solver.getBooleanSort()

# Declaring the predicates (functions)

red = solver.declareFun("red", [Person], Bool)
rough = solver.declareFun("rough", [Person], Bool)
nice = solver.declareFun("nice", [Person], Bool)
green = solver.declareFun("green", [Person], Bool)
round = solver.declareFun("round", [Person], Bool)

# Translating the statements into CVC5 formulas

x = solver.mkVar(Person, "x")

smart_implies_cold = solver.mkForall([x], solver.mkTerm(solver.Implies, solver.mkTerm(smart, x), solver.mkTerm(cold, x)))
solver.assertFormula(smart_implies_cold)

red_implies_rough = solver.mkForall([x], solver.mkTerm(solver.Implies, solver.mkTerm(red, x), solver.mkTerm(rough, x)))
solver.assertFormula(red_implies_rough)

nice_red_implies_green = solver.mkForall([x], solver.mkTerm(solver.Implies, solver.mkTerm(solver.And, solver.mkTerm(nice, x), solver.mkTerm(red, x)), solver.mkTerm(green, x)))
solver.assertFormula(nice_red_implies_green)

red_rough_implies_round = solver.mkForall([x], solver.mkTerm(solver.Implies, solver.mkTerm(solver.And, solver.mkTerm(red, x), solver.mkTerm(rough, x)), solver.mkTerm(round, x)))
solver.assertFormula(red_rough_implies_round)

rough_round_implies_smart = solver.mkForall([x], solver.mkTerm(solver.Implies, solver.mkTerm(solver.And, solver.mkTerm(rough, x), solver.mkTerm(round, x)), solver.mkTerm(smart, x)))
solver.assertFormula(rough_round_implies_smart)

Gary = solver.mkConst(Person, "Gary")
gary_condition = solver.mkTerm(solver.And, solver.mkTerm(smart, Gary), solver.mkTerm(cold, Gary))
gary_smart_cold_implies_nice = solver.mkTerm(solver.Implies, gary_condition, solver.mkTerm(nice, Gary))
solver.assertFormula(gary_smart_cold_implies_nice)

green_smart_implies_red = solver.mkForall([x], solver.mkTerm(solver.Implies, solver.mkTerm(solver.And, solver.mkTerm(green, x), solver.mkTerm(smart, x)), solver.mkTerm(red, x)))
solver.assertFormula(green_smart_implies_red)

Bob = solver.mkConst(Person, "Bob")
bob_is_cold = solver.mkTerm(cold, Bob)
solver.assertFormula(bob_is_cold)

bob_is_green = solver.mkTerm(green, Bob)
solver.assertFormula(bob_is_green)

bob_is_red = solver.mkTerm(red, Bob)
solver.assertFormula(bob_is_red)

bob_is_round = solver.mkTerm(round, Bob)
solver.assertFormula(bob_is_round)

Fiona = solver.mkConst(Person, "Fiona")
fiona_is_green = solver.mkTerm(green, Fiona)
solver.assertFormula(fiona_is_green)

fiona_is_smart = solver.mkTerm(smart, Fiona)
solver.assertFormula(fiona_is_smart)

gary_is_green = solver.mkTerm(green, Gary)
solver.assertFormula(gary_is_green)

gary_is_red = solver.mkTerm(red, Gary)
solver.assertFormula(gary_is_red)

Harry = solver.mkConst(Person, "Harry")
harry_is_green = solver.mkTerm(green, Harry)
solver.assertFormula(harry_is_green)

harry_is_smart = solver.mkTerm(smart, Harry)
solver.assertFormula(harry_is_smart)

# Test statement: 'Gary is not cold.'
gary_not_cold = solver.mkTerm(solver.Not, solver.mkTerm(cold, Gary))
solver.assertFormula(gary_not_cold)

# Check for satisfiability
if solver.checkSat().isSat():
    print("The test statement 'Gary is not cold.' is satisfied.")
else:
    print("The test statement 'Gary is not cold.' is unsatisfied.")
```

This code defines the parameters, translates the given statements into CVC5 formulas, and then evaluates the test statement with the CVC5 SMT solver.

Remember that to run the above code, you'll need the `cvc5` Python bindings installed and properly configured.
