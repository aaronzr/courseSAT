Minimum GPA Requirement (2.0): The cumulative GPA from the transcript is 3.698 which satisfies the minimum GPA requirement.

Given these details, "BS SAT" can be output as the student has successfully met all the BS degree requirements in Computer Science at Stanford University.========================GPT Answer to Prompt Two Regarding MS Requirements====================
Let's evaluate whether the student's transcript satisfies the requirements for the MS in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence.

### FOUNDATIONS REQUIREMENT:
**Must satisfy the following courses:**
1. Logic, Automata & Complexity (CS103) - **Completed** (Grade: B+)
2. Probability (CS109, Stat116, CME106, MS&E220, EE178) - **Completed** (CS109, Grade: B+)
3. Algorithmic Analysis (CS161) - **Completed** (Grade: A-)
4. Computer Org & Sys (CS107 or 107E) - **Completed** (CS107, Grade: B+)
5. Principles of Computer Systems (CS110 or CS111) - **Completed** (CS111, Grade: A)

### SIGNIFICANT IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENT:
**One course required:**
1. CS 210B - **Completed** (Grade: A)

### BREADTH REQUIREMENT:
**Three courses, one from each breadth area (A, B, C, or D):**
1. Area A. Mathematical and Theoretical Foundations: Not listed
2. Area B. Computer Systems: CS 140 - **Completed** (Grade: A-)
3. Area C. Applications: CS 231N - **Completed** (Grade: A)
