Let's go through each statement step by step and translate them into CVC5 Python formulas. The goal is to create expressions that can be evaluated using CVC5 to verify the final test statement.

First, we'll import CVC5 and initialize the solver:

```python
import cvc5
from cvc5 import Solver, Kind

solver = Solver()
solver.setLogic("QF_ALL")
```

Next, we need to define the boolean variables:

```python
# Define boolean variables for attributes and individuals
smart = solver.mkBoolSort()
green = solver.mkBoolSort()
big = solver.mkBoolSort()
young = solver.mkBoolSort()
round = solver.mkBoolSort()
quiet = solver.mkBoolSort()
blue = solver.mkBoolSort()

# Define booleans for individuals
Anne = {
    'big': solver.mkConst(smart, 'Anne_big'),
    'blue': solver.mkConst(blue, 'Anne_blue'),
    'young': solver.mkConst(young, 'Anne_young'),
    'round': solver.mkConst(round, 'Anne_round'),
    'green': solver.mkConst(green, 'Anne_green'),
    'quiet': solver.mkConst(quiet, 'Anne_quiet')
}

Charlie = {
    'big': solver.mkConst(smart, 'Charlie_big'),
    'blue': solver.mkConst(blue, 'Charlie_blue'),
    'young': solver.mkConst(young, 'Charlie_young'),
    'round': solver.mkConst(round, 'Charlie_round'),
    'green': solver.mkConst(green, 'Charlie_green'),
    'quiet': solver.mkConst(quiet, 'Charlie_quiet')
}

Dave = {
    'big': solver.mkConst(smart, 'Dave_big'),
    'blue': solver.mkConst(blue, 'Dave_blue'),
    'young': solver.mkConst(young, 'Dave_young'),
    'round': solver.mkConst(round, 'Dave_round'),
    'green': solver.mkConst(green, 'Dave_green'),
    'quiet': solver.mkConst(quiet, 'Dave_quiet')
}

Fiona = {
    'big': solver.mkConst(smart, 'Fiona_big'),
    'blue': solver.mkConst(blue, 'Fiona_blue'),
    'young': solver.mkConst(young, 'Fiona_young'),
    'round': solver.mkConst(round, 'Fiona_round'),
    'green': solver.mkConst(green, 'Fiona_green'),
    'quiet': solver.mkConst(quiet, 'Fiona_quiet')
}
```

Now let's translate each of the contextual statements:

1. If someone is smart and green then they are big.

```python
smart_and_green_implies_big = solver.mkExpr(Kind.IMPLIES,
                                            solver.mkAnd(smart, green),
                                            big)
solver.addFormula(smart_and_green_implies_big)
```

2. If someone is young and round then they are big.

```python
young_and_round_implies_big = solver.mkExpr(Kind.IMPLIES,
                                            solver.mkAnd(young, round),
                                            big)
solver.addFormula(young_and_round_implies_big)
```

3. Round people are quiet.

```python
round_implies_quiet = solver.mkExpr(Kind.IMPLIES, round, quiet)
solver.addFormula(round_implies_quiet)
```

4. If Anne is big then Anne is not round.

```python
anne_big_implies_not_round = solver.mkExpr(Kind.IMPLIES,
                                           Anne['big'],
                                           solver.mkNot(Anne['round']))
solver.addFormula(anne_big_implies_not_round)
```

5. Blue people are green.

```python
blue_implies_green = solver.mkExpr(Kind.IMPLIES, blue, green)
solver.addFormula(blue_implies_green)
```

6. If someone is round and blue then they are green.

```python
round_and_blue_implies_green = solver.mkExpr(Kind.IMPLIES,
                                             solver.mkAnd(round, blue),
                                             green)
solver.addFormula(round_and_blue_implies_green)
```

7. If someone is quiet then they are blue.

```python
quiet_implies_blue = solver.mkExpr(Kind.IMPLIES, quiet, blue)
solver.addFormula(quiet_implies_blue)
```

8. If Anne is young and Anne is round then Anne is green.

```python
anne_young_and_round_implies_green = solver.mkExpr(Kind.IMPLIES,
                                                   solver.mkAnd(Anne['young'], Anne['round']),
                                                   Anne['green'])
solver.addFormula(anne_young_and_round_implies_green)
```

9. If someone is green then they are young.

```python
green_implies_young = solver.mkExpr(Kind.IMPLIES, green, young)
solver.addFormula(green_implies_young)
```

Next, we assert the individual facts:

10. Anne is big.

```python
solver.assertFormula(Anne['big'])
```

11. Anne is blue.

```python
solver.assertFormula(Anne['blue'])
```

12. Anne is young.

```python
solver.assertFormula(Anne['young'])
```

13. Charlie is blue.

```python
solver.assertFormula(Charlie['blue'])
```

14. Charlie is green.

```python
solver.assertFormula(Charlie['green'])
```

15. Charlie is quiet.

```python
solver.assertFormula(Charlie['quiet'])
```

16. Charlie is young.

```python
solver.assertFormula(Charlie['young'])
```

17. Dave is round.

```python
solver.assertFormula(Dave['round'])
```

18. Fiona is blue.

```python
solver.assertFormula(Fiona['blue'])
```

19. Fiona is quiet.

```python
solver.assertFormula(Fiona['quiet'])
```

20. Fiona is not round.

```python
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkNot(Fiona['round']))
```

21. Fiona is young.

```python
solver.assertFormula(Fiona['young'])
```

Finally, we check the test statement "Anne is not green":

```python
anne_not_green = solver.mkNot(Anne['green'])

result = solver.checkSatAssuming(anne_not_green)
print('Anne is not green:', result.isSat())
```

This code fully translates the given statements and checks whether the test statement "Anne is not green" is consistent with the given information. To proceed, run this code in an environment where CVC5 Python API is installed.
