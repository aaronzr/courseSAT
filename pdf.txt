Restrictions: CS. 157 + Phil 151 maynot be used in combination to satisfy the Math electives requirement. Students who have taken both Math 51 & CME 100 will receive only 8 units credit in the  major due to overlapping material.( 3 )Any course of 3 or more units from the SoE Science List (see Courses page at ughb.stanford.edu), PSYCH 30, or AP Chemistry may be used.CS Artificial Intelligence Track Program Sheet (continued)This printed form must be signed by the departmental representative (SSO), with changes petitioned (see UGHB, Petitions page) and initialed/dated by SSO.(37 units min.
