To determine if the student satisfies the requirements for both the BS and MS degrees, we need to meticulously check the courses listed in their transcript against the degree requirements specified. Below is a step-by-step approach to evaluate their transcript.

### Step 1: BS Core Requirements
**BS Core Requirements:**
1. CS 106B: Programming Abstractions
2. CS 107: Computer Organization and Systems
3. CS 111: Principles of Computer Systems
4. CS 103: Mathematical Foundations of Computing
5. CS 109: Introduction to Probability for Computer Scientists
6. CS 161: Data Structures and Algorithms

**BS Senior Project Requirement:**
- Courses like CS 194, 194W, CS 210B, CS 191, or CS 191W

**BS AI Elective Requirements (43 units minimum):**
- Core: CS 107 or 107E, CS 111, CS 161
- Depth Courses: CS 221 plus two from different AI areas listed
- Additional AI or related electives

**BS Other Requirements:**
- Mathematics: MATH 19, 20, 21, CS 103, CS 109 plus electives from a list
- Science: PHYS 41, PHYS 43 plus one elective
- Engineering Fundamentals: CS 106B, ENGR 40M or 76

### Step 2: MS Specialization Requirements
**MS Foundation Requirements:**
1. CS 103 (Logic, Automata & Complexity)
2. CS 109, Stat116, CME106, MS&E220, or EE178 (Probability)
3. CS 161 (Algorithmic Analysis)
4. CS 107 or 107E (Computer Org & Sys)
5. CS 110 or 111 (Principles of Computer Systems)

**Significant Implementation Requirement:**
- One course from a specified list such as CS 140, 221, 231N, etc.

**MS Breadth Requirement:**
- Three courses, each from a different area (A, B, C, D)

**AI Depth Requirement:**
- CS 221
- Four from specified AI courses

**MS Elective Requirements:**
- Additional courses to complete 45-unit requirement for MS

### Step 3: Evaluate the Transcript
Based on the given paths and details in the student's transcript file (`LLM_stanford_transcript1_SAT_8.txt`), we analyze compliance with these requirements.

1. **Check Core Courses:**
    - Verify if courses listed in Sections 1 (‘BS Core Requirements’) and 2 (‘MS Foundation Requirements’) have been taken and passed with a required unit or letter grade.

2. **Senior Project:**
    - Confirm that one of the senior project courses listed has been completed.

3. **AI Depth Requirement for BS and MS:**
    - Verify if the student has taken CS 221 and check four from specified AI depth courses.

4. **Breadth Requirement for MS:**
    - Confirm courses from different Breadth areas (A, B, C, D)

5. **Elective Credits for MS:**
    - Ensure electives complete the overall 45-unit degree requirement for MS.

### Output Result
If all BS core, senior project, AI elective requirements, and MS specialization requirements are satisfied, output:
```plaintext
BS SAT
MS SAT
```
Otherwise, list the specific unsatisfied courses for both BS and MS degrees.

### Example Analysis Execution
Unfortunately, I cannot access the student's transcript directly here. However, if you provide me with the details from the file, I can help determine if the student has met the requirements for both degrees. You can provide the data in the following format for analysis:

- **BS Courses Taken:** List all relevant courses along with grades and units.
- **MS Courses Taken:** Same for MS along with units and grades.
