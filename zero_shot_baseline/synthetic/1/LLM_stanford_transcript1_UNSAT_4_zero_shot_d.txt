END OF TRANSCRIPT.
==================================================================GPT Answer to Prompt One Regarding BS Requirements====================
Based on Alex Robert Wilson's transcript and the requirements for a Bachelor in Science (BS) degree in Computer Science at Stanford University, we need to verify that Alex has satisfied the following requirements:

### Core Requirements:
1. **CS106B: Programming Abstractions**
2. **CS107 or CS107E: Computer Organization and Systems**
3. **CS111: Operating Systems Principles**
4. **CS103: Mathematical Foundations of Computing**
5. **CS109: Introduction to Probability for Computer Scientists**
6. **CS161: Design and Analysis of Algorithms**

### Senior Project:
- **CS194 / CS194W / CS210B / CS191 / CS191W / CS294** or equivalent senior project course.

### AI Electives:
- **AI Core Courses:**
  1. CS221: Artificial Intelligence: Principles and Techniques
  2. Track Requirement B (AI Methods/Natural Language Processing/Vision/Robotics)

- **Depth Requirements:**
  - One additional course from the Track Requirement B list.
  - Additional electives from the CS-approved list.
  - The WiM (Writing in the Major) requirement, which can be met via a senior project course.

### General Diploma and GPA Requirements:
- Minimum of 2.0 GPA in ENGR Fundamentals, CS Core, Depth, and Senior Project combined.
- At least 43 units in CS Core, Depth, and Senior Project combined.
- Overall, the courses should be taken for a letter grade where required.

### Analysis of the Transcript:
1. **CS Core Requirements:**
   - **CS106A**: Programming Methodology (C+) (Not counted as core but suggests prior programming experience)
   - **CS106B**: Programming Abstractions (D+)
   - **CS107E**: Computer Systems Engineering (D)
   - **CS111**: Operating Systems Principles (D-)
   - **CS103**: Not recorded in transcript.
   - **CS109**: Introduction to Probability (D+)
   - **CS161**: Design and Analysis of Algorithms (D+)

2. **Senior Project:**
   - No senior project course (CS194 / CS194W / CS210B / CS191 / CS191W / CS294) recorded.

3. **AI Electives:**
   - **CS221**: Artificial Intelligence (D)
   - **CS224N**: Natural Language Processing (D)
   - Additional electives (not sufficiently clear from transcript provided)

4. **Mathematics and Statistics Requirements:**
   - **MATH 19**: Calculus (D)
   - **MATH 51**: Linear Algebra (D+)
   - **MATH 52**: Multivariable Calculus (D+)
   - **MATH 53**: Complex Variables (D+)

5. **Science Requirements:**
   - **PHYS 21 & 43**: Mechanics and Electricity (C-)
   - Other Science courses: Completed, though general performance is on the lower end.

### Summary:
The student's transcript shows multiple courses completed with grades D or higher, yet many core computer science courses were passed with marginal grades (D+ or D), which might not meet minimal achievement levels expected for degree completion. The Senior Project requirement is notably missing, which is critical for graduation.

### Conclusion:
Based on the transcript analysis, the following requirements are unsatisfied:
1. **CS103: Mathematical Foundations of Computing** (Not recorded in transcript)
2. **Senior Project** (No completed senior project course)
3. **General GPA and course quality threshold issues**: Many core courses have D grades which might not satisfy department standards.

### Output:
```
CS103
Senior Project
Core GPA requirement concerns
```
Given this output, it is clear that the student has not fully satisfied the BS degree requirements.========================GPT Answer to Prompt Two Regarding MS Requirements====================
Based on the MS in Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence Specialization requirements, let's analyze Alex Robert Wilson's transcript step by step:

### Foundation Courses
- **CS 103 (Logic, Automata & Complexity):** Not found in transcript.
- **Probability:** CS 109 (Introduction to Probability) - Grade: D+
- **CS 161 (Algorithmic Analysis):** Grade: D+
- **CS 107/107E (Computer Organization & Systems):** CS 107E - Grade: D
- **CS 110/111 (Principles of Computer Systems):** CS 111 - Grade: D-

None of these grades meet the minimum requirement typically expected, which usually is at least a passing grade (C or better).

### Significant Implementation Course
Only a few courses satisfy the significant implementation course requirement and they must be taken at Stanford for a letter grade:
- **Courses like CS 140, 143, 144, 145, 148, 151, 190, etc.:** None listed in the transcript.

### Breadth Requirement
Three courses from different areas (A, B, C, D):
- **Area A:** No matching courses.
- **Area B:** No matching courses.
- **Area C:** CS 224N - Grade: D
- **Area D:** No matching courses.

### AI Depth Requirement
- **CS 221:** Completed with Grade: D
- Four additional courses from a specified list:
  - CS 224N (Natural Language Processing) - Grade: D
  - No other relevant courses from required list

Total Depth Units completed: With given grades, not adequate.

### Electives
Must complete a total of at least 45 units for MS, incorporating the other non-countable courses:
No additional elective courses present in the transcript relevant to MS electives category.

### Additional Requirements
- At most 10 units of foundations courses can count. Calculations are skipped since courses aren’t qualified.
- At least 36 units need to be letter grades. Not achieved.
- Overall 45 units required: Not achieved.
- B average minimum in submitted courses is required: Not achieved with GPA of 2.573.

### Conclusively:
- Foundations Requirement: **Not satisfied.**
- Significant Implementation: **No valid courses found or listed.**
- Breadth Requirement: **Not satisfied.**
- AI Depth Requirement: **Not satisfied.**
- Electives: **No valid electives listed for CS degree.**
- Overarching requirements, such as minimum units and GPA: **Not met.**

**Result:**
```
Courses not satisfied:
- Foundations Requirement
- Significant Implementation Requirement
- Breadth Requirement
- AI Depth Requirement
- Electives
- Overall minimum units, GPA, course requirements

MS NOT SAT
