Certainly! Here is the natural language translation of the given SMT formulas.

"To satisfy the conditions:
1. One of the following must be true for Logic, Automata & Complexity:
   - It is equivalent to CME 100
   - It is equivalent to CME 102
   - It is equivalent to CME 104
   - It is equivalent to CS 106B
   - It is equivalent to CME 106

2. One of the following must be true for Probability:
   - It is equivalent to CME 100
   - It is equivalent to CME 102
   - It is equivalent to CME 104
   - It is equivalent to CS 106B
   - It is equivalent to CME 106

3. One of the following must be true for Algorithmic Analysis:
   - It is equivalent to CME 100
   - It is equivalent to CME 102
   - It is equivalent to CME 104
   - It is equivalent to CS 106B
   - It is equivalent to CME 106

4. One of the following must be true for Computer Organization & Systems:
   - It is equivalent to CME 100
   - It is equivalent to CME 102
   - It is equivalent to CME 104
   - It is equivalent to CS 106B
   - It is equivalent to CME 106

5. One of the following must be true for Principles of Computer Systems:
   - It is equivalent to CME 100
   - It is equivalent to CME 102
   - It is equivalent to CME 104
   - It is equivalent to CS 106B
   - It is equivalent to CME 106

Additionally, the sum of the values (5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0, and 4.0) must be less than or equal to 10.0.

Finally, the statement "None" is equivalent to CS103."
