['If something is round then it chases the bear.', 'If something eats the bear and it does not need the bald eagle then it chases the bear.', 'If something chases the bear then it needs the tiger.', 'If something chases the mouse and the mouse is red then it does not eat the bald eagle.', 'If something is red then it does not eat the bald eagle.', 'If something is round and it needs the tiger then the tiger is round.', 'If something needs the bald eagle then it is not red.', 'If something needs the bald eagle and the bald eagle eats the tiger then the tiger eats the mouse.', 'If something is round and it does not eat the mouse then it does not need the mouse.', 'The bald eagle does not need the mouse.', 'The bear does not eat the bald eagle.', 'The bear eats the tiger.', 'The mouse chases the bald eagle.', 'The mouse eats the bear.', 'The mouse is round.', 'The tiger eats the bear.']The mouse does not chase the bear.To translate the given contextual statements into CVC5 python formulas, we first need to define the predicates and objects appearing in these statements. Here are the predicates and their meanings:

- `Round(x)`: `x` is round.
- `Chases(x, y)`: `x` chases `y`.
- `Eats(x, y)`: `x` eats `y`.
- `Needs(x, y)`: `x` needs `y`.
- `Red(x)`: `x` is red.

And the objects:
- `bear`
- `bald_eagle`
- `mouse`
- `tiger`

Let's start translating each sentence.

### Contextual Sentences

1. **If something is round then it chases the bear.**
   \[
   \forall x \; (Round(x) \rightarrow Chases(x, bear)) \]

2. **If something eats the bear and it does not need the bald eagle then it chases the bear.**
   \[
   \forall x \; (Eats(x, bear) \land \neg Needs(x, bald_eagle) \rightarrow Chases(x, bear)) \]

3. **If something chases the bear then it needs the tiger.**
   \[
   \forall x \; (Chases(x, bear) \rightarrow Needs(x, tiger)) \]

### CVC5 Python Script

Now we will write the Python script to implement the above translations using the CVC5 SMT solver.

```python
import cvc5
from cvc5 import Solver, Kind

# Initialize the solver
solver = Solver()
solver.setLogic("QF_UF")

# Define sorts
Bool = solver.getBooleanSort()

# Define functions
Round = solver.mkFuncDecl("Round", solver.mkUninterpretedSort("Object"), Bool)
Chases = solver.mkFuncDecl("Chases", solver.mkUninterpretedSort("Object"), solver.mkUninterpretedSort("Object"), Bool)
Eats = solver.mkFuncDecl("Eats", solver.mkUninterpretedSort("Object"), solver.mkUninterpretedSort("Object"), Bool)
Needs = solver.mkFuncDecl("Needs", solver.mkUninterpretedSort("Object"), solver.mkUninterpretedSort("Object"), Bool)
Red = solver.mkFuncDecl("Red", solver.mkUninterpretedSort("Object"), Bool)

# Define constants
bear = solver.mkConst(solver.mkUninterpretedSort("Object"), "bear")
bald_eagle = solver.mkConst(solver.mkUninterpretedSort("Object"), "bald_eagle")
mouse = solver.mkConst(solver.mkUninterpretedSort("Object"), "mouse")
tiger = solver.mkConst(solver.mkUninterpretedSort("Object"), "tiger")

# Formulate the translated statements as assertions
# 1. If something is round then it chases the bear.
x = solver.mkVar(solver.mkUninterpretedSort("Object"), "x")
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkForall([x], solver.mkImplication(Round(x), Chases(x, bear))))

# 2. If something eats the bear and it does not need the bald eagle then it chases the bear.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkForall([x], solver.mkImplication(
    solver.mkAnd(Eats(x, bear), solver.mkNot(Needs(x, bald_eagle))), Chases(x, bear)
)))

# 3. If something chases the bear then it needs the tiger.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkForall([x], solver.mkImplication(Chases(x, bear), Needs(x, tiger))))

# 4. If something chases the mouse and the mouse is red then it does not eat the bald eagle.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkForall([x], solver.mkImplication(
    solver.mkAnd(Chases(x, mouse), Red(mouse)), solver.mkNot(Eats(x, bald_eagle))
)))

# 5. If something is red then it does not eat the bald eagle.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkForall([x], solver.mkImplication(Red(x), solver.mkNot(Eats(x, bald_eagle)))))

# 6. If something is round and it needs the tiger then the tiger is round.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkForall([x], solver.mkImplication(
    solver.mkAnd(Round(x), Needs(x, tiger)), Round(tiger)
)))

# 7. If something needs the bald eagle then it is not red.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkForall([x], solver.mkImplication(Needs(x, bald_eagle), solver.mkNot(Red(x)))))

# 8. If something needs the bald eagle and the bald eagle eats the tiger then the tiger eats the mouse.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkForall([x], solver.mkImplication(
    solver.mkAnd(Needs(x, bald_eagle), Eats(bald_eagle, tiger)), Eats(tiger, mouse)
)))

# 9. If something is round and it does not eat the mouse then it does not need the mouse.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkForall([x], solver.mkImplication(
    solver.mkAnd(Round(x), solver.mkNot(Eats(x, mouse))), solver.mkNot(Needs(x, mouse))
)))

# 10. The bald eagle does not need the mouse.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkNot(Needs(bald_eagle, mouse)))

# 11. The bear does not eat the bald eagle.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkNot(Eats(bear, bald_eagle)))

# 12. The bear eats the tiger.
solver.assertFormula(Eats(bear, tiger))

# 13. The mouse chases the bald eagle.
solver.assertFormula(Chases(mouse, bald_eagle))

# 14. The mouse eats the bear.
solver.assertFormula(Eats(mouse, bear))

# 15. The mouse is round.
solver.assertFormula(Round(mouse))

# 16. The tiger eats the bear.
solver.assertFormula(Eats(tiger, bear))

# Test Statement: The mouse does not chase the bear.
test_statement = solver.mkNot(Chases(mouse, bear))

# Check satisfiability
solver.assertFormula(test_statement)
result = solver.checkSat()

print("Test statement: The mouse does not chase the bear.")
print("Satisfiability:", result)

if result.isSat():
    print("The test statement is satisfied.")
else:
    print("The test statement is not satisfied.")
```

This script sets up the CVC5 SMT solver, translates each statement from the context into formulae, and checks whether the test statement is satisfied.
