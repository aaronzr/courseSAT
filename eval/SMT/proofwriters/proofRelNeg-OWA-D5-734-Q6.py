We'll then encode these statements using the SMT logic provided by the CVC5 library. 

Here's how we can accomplish this step by step:

1. **Installation of CVC5**:
   Ensure you have installed the Python CVC5 library. You can install it using pip if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   pip install cvc5
   ```

2. **Translating Statements**:
   We will encode each contextual statement and the test statement given.

Let's start with the translation process in Python:
```python
import cvc5

# Create SMT solver instance
solver = cvc5.Solver()

# Set the logic
solver.setLogic("QF_UF")

# Define sorts for entities and predicates
Entity = solver.mkUninterpretedSort("Entity")
Predicate = solver.mkFunctionType([Entity], solver.getBooleanSort())

# Define entities
baldEagle = solver.mkConst(Entity, "baldEagle")
cat = solver.mkConst(Entity, "cat")
lion = solver.mkConst(Entity, "lion")
rabbit = solver.mkConst(Entity, "rabbit")

# Define predicates
isNice = solver.mkConst(Predicate, "isNice")
isRed = solver.mkConst(Predicate, "isRed")
isGreen = solver.mkConst(Predicate, "isGreen")
isKind = solver.mkConst(Predicate, "isKind")
isYoung = solver.mkConst(Predicate, "isYoung")
eats = solver.mkConst(solver.mkFunctionType([Entity, Entity], solver.getBooleanSort()), "eats")
likes = solver.mkConst(solver.mkFunctionType([Entity, Entity], solver.getBooleanSort()), "likes")
needs = solver.mkConst(solver.mkFunctionType([Entity, Entity], solver.getBooleanSort()), "needs")

solver.assertFormula(test_statement)

if result.isSat():
    print("The test statement is unsatisfied (i.e., The bald eagle eats the lion).")
else:
    print("The test statement is satisfied (i.e., The bald eagle does not eat the lion).")

# Check the overall consistency of the formulas
result = solver.checkSat()
if result.isSat():
    print("The overall set of statements is consistent.")
else:
    print("The overall set of statements is inconsistent.")
```

This code defines the logical relationships as described in the contextual statements using the CVC5 SMT solver and checks whether the provided test statement ("The bald eagle does not eat the lion.") is satisfied or not.

To understand better or debug any inconsistencies, you can also add more detailed output or intermediary checks.
