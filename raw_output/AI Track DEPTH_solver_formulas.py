# Define and add other constraints if required

# Start solving
if solver.checkSat().isSat():
    print("The constraints are satisfiable.")
else:
    print("The constraints are not satisfiable.")
```

In this code:
- We initialize a solver and create boolean variables for each course.
- We assert the required constraints for core courses, Track Requirement A, B, and C, and Track Electives.
- Finally, the code checks if the constraints are satisfiable.

Please ensure the placeholders for the unit values are correctly updated to match the actual units in the official curriculum or course catalog for accurate constraint validation.
