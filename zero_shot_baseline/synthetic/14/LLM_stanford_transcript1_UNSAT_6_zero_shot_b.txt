### BS Requirement Analysis

Below are the requirements for a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and an analysis of Alicia Marie Jackson's transcript against these requirements:

#### Core Requirements:
1. **CS 106B: Programming Abstractions** - Taken and passed with B-
2. **CS 107: Computer Organization and Systems** - Taken and passed with D-
3. **CS 103: Mathematical Foundations of Computing** - Not found on transcript
4. **CS 109: Introduction to Probability for Computer Scientists** - Not found on transcript
5. **CS 111: Operating Systems Principles** - Taken and passed with C
6. **CS 161: Data Structures and Algorithms** - Taken and passed with C+

#### Senior Project Requirement:
1. **CS 210B: Project Experience with Corporate Partners** - Taken and passed with C
2. All parts of the senior project requirement seem to be satisfied by Alicia.

#### Mathematics Requirements:
1. **MATH 19/20/21** - AP credits for Calculus AB satisfied this requirement
2. **MATH 51: Linear Algebra and Differential Equations** - Taken and passed with C
3. Additional Math Electives - MATH 52 and PHIL 151 are counted:
   - MATH 52 - Passed with B-
   - PHIL 151 - Passed with A-

#### Science Requirements:
1. **PHYSICS 61** - Taken and passed with A-
2. **PHYSICS 63** - Taken and passed with C+
3. Additional electives - Not specified in analysis.

#### Technology in Society Requirement:
- Not directly found on the transcript.

#### Engineering Fundamentals:
1. **CS 106A: Programming Methodology** - Taken and passed with B
2. **PHYS 100: Modern Physics Laboratory** - Passed with CR (Credit)
3. **EE 102: Introduction to Logic Design** - Taken and passed with B

#### Depth Requirements:
Confirmed courses are not directly listed, needed further confirmation from the advisor.

### Unsatisfied BS Requirements:
1. **CS 103: Mathematical Foundations of Computing** - Not completed.
2. **CS 109: Introduction to Probability for Computer Scientists** - Not completed.
3. **Technology in Society Requirement** - Not found on transcript.

### BS Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the BS degree requirements have not been fully satisfied yet.

### MS Requirement Analysis

We proceed with the analysis of the MS requirements, but given the BS requirements are not fully satisfied, the MS assessment follows just for completion:

#### Foundations Requirement:
1. **CS 107 or CS 107E: Computer Organization and Systems** - Passed with D-
2. **CS 161: Algorithmic Analysis** - Passed with C+
3. **CS 103: Logic, Automata, and Complexity** - Not completed (Critical requirement missing)
4. **CS 109: Probability** - Not completed (Critical requirement missing)
5. **CS 110 or CS 111: Principles of Computer Systems** - CS 111 was passed with C

#### Significant Implementation:
To be completed during MS, we need to identify a course that counts against this, e.g., CS 210B.

#### Breadth Requirement:
Pending specific course completion, not mapped due to lack of definitive depth course completions and particular breadth area requirements.

#### AI Depth:
Depth courses such as CS 233 are taken but not declared if they match exactly; further acceptance needed from advisor.

### Courses Not Satisfied for MS:
1. **CS 103** - Not completed.
2. **CS 109** - Not completed.
3. **Breadth and Depth courses** â€“ Need specific validation from advisor approval and further core requirements.

### Conclusion:
No need to delve deeper; crucial foundational courses missed like CS 103 and CS 109 make the assertion for MS incompletely qualified along with some unlisted breadth core requirements.

### Final Answer

- **For BS:** CS 103 and CS 109 missing, and Technology in Society requirement not satisfied.
- **For MS:** Foundations requirements for CS 103 and CS 109 missing and some Breadth areas and approval specifics not confirmed due to incomplete BS.

**Output:**

```plaintext
BS NOT SAT - Missing: CS 103, CS 109, Technology in Society
```
