First, let's outline the variables we might need:
- For each person (Gary, Erin, Dave, Fiona), we will define boolean variables for the properties: blue, young, cold, nice, kind, quiet, and furry.

Let's translate each contextual statement and then the test statement into CVC5 SMT formulas.

1. **Statement: 'Blue people are young.'**
   Formula: ∀x (blue(x) ⇒ young(x))

```python
import cvc5

solver = cvc5.Solver()

# Create variables
blue = {name: solver.mkBoolean(name + "_blue") for name in ["Gary", "Erin", "Dave", "Fiona"]}
young = {name: solver.mkBoolean(name + "_young") for name in ["Gary", "Erin", "Dave", "Fiona"]}
cold = {name: solver.mkBoolean(name + "_cold") for name in ["Gary", "Erin", "Dave", "Fiona"]}
nice = {name: solver.mkBoolean(name + "_nice") for name in ["Gary", "Erin", "Dave", "Fiona"]}
kind = {name: solver.mkBoolean(name + "_kind") for name in ["Gary", "Erin", "Dave", "Fiona"]}
quiet = {name: solver.mkBoolean(name + "_quiet") for name in ["Gary", "Erin", "Dave", "Fiona"]}
furry = {name: solver.mkBoolean(name + "_furry") for name in ["Gary", "Erin", "Dave", "Fiona"]}

# Blue people are young.
for name in blue.keys():
    solver.add(blue[name].imp(young[name]))

# If someone is cold and nice then they are kind.
for name in blue.keys():
    solver.add(cold[name].and_term(nice[name]).imp(kind[name]))

# All quiet people are nice.
for name in blue.keys():
    solver.add(quiet[name].imp(nice[name]))

# If someone is kind and quiet then they are cold.
for name in blue.keys():
    solver.add(kind[name].and_term(quiet[name]).imp(cold[name]))

# If Gary is quiet and Gary is furry then Gary is cold.
solver.add(quiet["Gary"].and_term(furry["Gary"]).imp(cold["Gary"]))

# If Erin is blue and Erin is young then Erin is nice.
solver.add(blue["Erin"].and_term(young["Erin"]).imp(nice["Erin"]))

# Furry people are quiet.
for name in blue.keys():
    solver.add(furry[name].imp(quiet[name]))

# All kind, cold people are blue.
for name in blue.keys():
    solver.add(kind[name].and_term(cold[name]).imp(blue[name]))

# If Erin is furry then Erin is kind.
solver.add(furry["Erin"].imp(kind["Erin"]))

# Add facts about Dave, Erin, Fiona, Gary
facts = [
    ("Dave", "cold"), ("Dave", "furry"), ("Dave", "nice"), ("Dave", "young"),
    ("Erin", "cold"), ("Erin", "furry"), ("Erin", "nice"), ("Erin", "young"),
    ("Fiona", "cold"), ("Fiona", "furry"), ("Fiona", "kind"), ("Fiona", "nice"), ("Fiona", "quiet"), ("Fiona", "young"),
    ("Gary", "furry"), ("Gary", "nice")
]

for name, prop in facts:
    globals()[prop][name] = solver.mkBoolean(True)
    solver.add(globals()[prop][name])

# Test statement: Erin is blue.
test_expr = blue["Erin"]

# Check satisfiability
print("Checking if 'Erin is blue' is satisfiable given the context...")
result = solver.checkSatAssuming(test_expr)

if result.isSat():
    print("Satisfied: Erin can be blue.")
else:
    print("Unsatisfied: Erin cannot be blue.")
```
Explanation:
- We defined a SMT solver and created boolean variables for each attribute of each person.
- For each contextual statement, we've added implications or direct assignments to the solver.
- Finally, we check the satisfiability of the test statement "Erin is blue."

You can copy and run this code snippet in a Python environment that supports `cvc5`, and it will check whether Erin can be blue given the provided context.
