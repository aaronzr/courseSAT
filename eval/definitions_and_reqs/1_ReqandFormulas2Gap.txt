### Analysis of SMT Formulas:
1. **Variable Assignments and Units Requirements**:
   - For each category (course_a to course_e), multiple conditions need to be satisfied. Each condition within `and` clauses tries to check if a specific course corresponds to a category and if the units are as expected.
   - Mandatory unit values: `course_a_units`, `course_b_units`, `course_c_units`, `course_d_units` should each respectively have values of 5. `course_e_units` must be 5 units.
   - The total units earned for all categories should be less than or equal to 10.

2. **Specific Category Assignments**:
   - There is an attempt to match each variable (`course_a` to `course_e`) with a permitted set of courses but errors seem to exist, as all courses mentioned in `course_a` conditions are unrelated or have unit values not matching the expected categories.

3. **Constantataional Contradictions**:
   - `and` clauses define one variable per course category, trying to match multiple invalid courses and unrelated checks, resulting in contradictions.

### Unfilled Requirements:
1. **Logic, Automata & Complexity**: No course such as `CS103` is ever successfully matched.
2. **Probability**: Although many courses like `CS109`, `Stat116`, `CME106`, etc. are listed, the equations are forcing unrelated constraints.
3. **Algorithmic Analysis**: No proper match to `CS161`.
4. **Computer Organ & Sys**: `CS107` or `CS107E` aren't being matched properly.
5. **Principles of Computer Systems**: No valid match of `CS110` or `CS111` due to contradictory formulas.

### Detailed Observations:

1. **Unit Errors**:
   - Conditions requiring certain units don't make logical sense per each course category and overall limits aren't possible.

2. **Logical Errors**:
   - Conflicts by forcing incorrect equivalences and irrelevant course assignments. For instance, there are erroneous checks like `= "None" "CS 103"` or `= course_a "CS109"`.

### Conclusion:
Analyzing the SMT formulas and variable definitions, the constraints given fail to validate any required courses, units or, properly correspond to the categories needed. All five required courses and their units are unfilled due to conflicting or incorrectly designed constraints.
