        ===================generated formulas===========================
To convert the requirements and constraints from the FINRA Rule 2090 "Know Your Customer" into CVC5 SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) formulas, we need to formulate logical conditions that represent these requirements. Here is a step-by-step approach to constructing the SMT formulas:

### Requirements and Constraints in SMT Formulas

1. **Reasonable Diligence**:
   Every member must use reasonable diligence concerning the opening and maintenance of every account.

   ```smt
   (declare-fun ReasonableDiligence (Account) Bool)
   (assert (forall ((acc Account)) (ReasonableDiligence acc)))
   ```

2. **Essential Facts**:
   - Members must know and retain the essential facts concerning every customer.
   - Members must understand the authority of each person acting on behalf of such customer.

   ```smt
   (declare-fun KnowsEssentialFacts (Customer) Bool)
   (declare-fun RetainsEssentialFacts (Customer) Bool)
   (declare-fun UnderstandsAuthority (Customer Person) Bool)

   (assert (forall ((cust Customer)) (KnowsEssentialFacts cust)))
   (assert (forall ((cust Customer)) (RetainsEssentialFacts cust)))
   (assert (forall ((cust Customer) (person Person)) (UnderstandsAuthority cust person)))
   ```

### Supplementary Material - Essential Facts:

1. *Effectively Service the Customer's Account*:
   - Facts essential to knowing the customer should allow effective servicing of the customer's account.

   ```smt
   (declare-fun EffectiveService (Customer Account) Bool)
   
   ; If we know the essential facts about a customer, we can effectively service their account
   (assert (forall ((cust Customer) (acc Account)) 
                 (=> (KnowsEssentialFacts cust) (EffectiveService cust acc))))
   ```

2. *Special Handling Instructions*:
   - Knowledge of any special handling instructions for the account.

   ```smt
   (declare-fun SpecialHandlingInstructions (Account) Bool)
   (declare-fun KnowsSpecialHandlingInstructions (Account) Bool)
   
   ; If an account requires special handling, members must know these instructions
   (assert (forall ((acc Account)) 
                 (=> (SpecialHandlingInstructions acc) (KnowsSpecialHandlingInstructions acc))))
   ```

3. *Authority of Each Person*:
   - Understanding the authority of each person acting on behalf of the customer.

   ```smt
   (assert (forall ((cust Customer) (person Person)) 
                 (UnderstandsAuthority cust person)))
   ```

4. *Compliance*:
   - Complying with applicable laws, regulations, and rules.

   ```smt
   (declare-fun ComplysWithLaws (Member) Bool)
   (assert (forall ((member Member)) (ComplysWithLaws member)))
   ```

### Constraints:

1. The rule was adopted by SR-FINRA-2010-039 and amended by SR-FINRA-2011-016, effective July 9, 2012.

   ```smt
   ; Constants for rule adoption and amendment
   (declare-const SR_FINRA_2010_039 Bool)
   (declare-const SR_FINRA_2011_016 Bool)
   (declare-const RuleEffectiveDate Date)

   (assert SR_FINRA_2010_039)
   (assert (and SR_FINRA_2011_016
                (= RuleEffectiveDate (date 2012 7 9))))
   ```

2. Reference Notices include 11-02, 11-25, and 12-25, which provide additional guidance on the rule.

   ```smt
   ; Constants for regulatory notices
   (declare-const Notice_11_02 Bool)
   (declare-const Notice_11_25 Bool)
   (declare-const Notice_12_25 Bool)

   (assert Notice_11_02)
   (assert Notice_11_25)
   (assert Notice_12_25)
   ```

### References:

1. Regulatory Notice 12-25
2. Regulatory Notice 11-25
3. Regulatory Notice 11-02

   ```smt
   ; Assume references are always true for simplicity
  
   (assert (forall ((r1 RegulatoryNotice_12_25) (r2 RegulatoryNotice_11_25) (r3 RegulatoryNotice_11_02))
                   (and r1 r2 r3)))
   ```

### Combining All Constraints

```smt
(set-logic ALL)
(declare-datatypes () ((Account) (Customer) (Person) (Member) (Date)))

(declare-fun ReasonableDiligence (Account) Bool)
(declare-fun KnowsEssentialFacts (Customer) Bool)
(declare-fun RetainsEssentialFacts (Customer) Bool)
(declare-fun UnderstandsAuthority (Customer Person) Bool)
(declare-fun EffectiveService (Customer Account) Bool)
(declare-fun SpecialHandlingInstructions (Account) Bool)
(declare-fun KnowsSpecialHandlingInstructions (Account) Bool)
(declare-fun ComplysWithLaws (Member) Bool)
(declare-const SR_FINRA_2010_039 Bool)
(declare-const SR_FINRA_2011_016 Bool)
(declare-const RuleEffectiveDate Date)
(declare-const Notice_11_02 Bool)
(declare-const Notice_11_25 Bool)
(declare-const Notice_12_25 Bool)

(assert (forall ((acc Account)) (ReasonableDiligence acc)))
(assert (forall ((cust Customer)) (KnowsEssentialFacts cust)))
(assert (forall ((cust Customer)) (RetainsEssentialFacts cust)))
(assert (forall ((cust Customer) (person Person)) (UnderstandsAuthority cust person)))

(assert (forall ((cust Customer) (acc Account)) 
                (=> (KnowsEssentialFacts cust) (EffectiveService cust acc))))
(assert (forall ((acc Account)) 
                (=> (SpecialHandlingInstructions acc) (KnowsSpecialHandlingInstructions acc))))
(assert (forall ((cust Customer) (person Person)) (UnderstandsAuthority cust person)))
(assert (forall ((member Member)) (ComplysWithLaws member)))

(assert SR_FINRA_2010_039)
(assert (and SR_FINRA_2011_016 (= RuleEffectiveDate (date 2012 7 9))))
(assert Notice_11_02)
(assert Notice_11_25)
(assert Notice_12_25)

(check-sat)
(get-model)
```

These SMT formulas ensure that the given constraints related to the "Know Your Customer" rule are modeled and verified with CVC5.
