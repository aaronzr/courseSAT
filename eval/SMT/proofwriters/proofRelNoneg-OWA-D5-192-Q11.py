CVC5 is an SMT solver that understands logical formulas in a variety of theories, including first-order logic. We'll use it to parse our logical statements about entities like cats, mice, and tigers.

Let's begin by translating each sentence.

```python
import cvc5

# Initialize solver
solver = cvc5.Solver()
# Set logic to quantifiers and uninterpreted functions
solver.setLogic("UF")

# Define sorts
Person = solver.getUninterpretedSort("Person")

# Define individuals
cow = solver.mkConst(Person, "cow")
cat = solver.mkConst(Person, "cat")
mouse = solver.mkConst(Person, "mouse")
tiger = solver.mkConst(Person, "tiger")

# Define properties
blue = solver.mkUnaryPredicate(Person, "blue")
nice = solver.mkUnaryPredicate(Person, "nice")
green = solver.mkUnaryPredicate(Person, "green")
round = solver.mkUnaryPredicate(Person, "round")
big = solver.mkUnaryPredicate(Person, "big")

# Define binary relations
chases = solver.mkPredicate(2, Person, "chases")
eats = solver.mkPredicate(2, Person, "eats")
likes = solver.mkPredicate(2, Person, "likes")

# Contextual Statements
# If someone chases the cow and they chase the mouse then the mouse is blue.
person = solver.mkBoundVar(Person, "person")
stmt1 = solver.mkIf(solver.mkAnd(chases(person, cow), chases(person, mouse)), blue(mouse))

# If someone eats the cat then they are nice.
stmt2 = solver.mkForall([person], solver.mkImplies(eats(person, cat), nice(person)))

# If the cat eats the mouse then the mouse likes the cow.
stmt3 = solver.mkImplies(eats(cat, mouse), likes(mouse, cow))

# If someone chases the mouse and they are round then they are big.
stmt4 = solver.mkForall([person], solver.mkImplies(solver.mkAnd(chases(person, mouse), round(person)), big(person)))

# If someone chases the tiger and the tiger chases the cat then the tiger is round.
stmt5 = solver.mkForall([person], solver.mkImplies(solver.mkAnd(chases(person, tiger), chases(tiger, cat)), round(tiger)))

# If someone eats the tiger and they like the cat then the cat likes the cow.
stmt6 = solver.mkForall([person], solver.mkImplies(solver.mkAnd(eats(person, tiger), likes(person, cat)), likes(cat, cow)))

# If the mouse likes the cow and the mouse chases the cow then the cow eats the cat.
stmt7 = solver.mkImplies(solver.mkAnd(likes(mouse, cow), chases(mouse, cow)), eats(cow, cat))

# If someone eats the cow and they eat the cat then they chase the tiger.
stmt8 = solver.mkForall([person], solver.mkImplies(solver.mkAnd(eats(person, cow), eats(person, cat)), chases(person, tiger)))

# If someone eats the tiger and they eat the cat then the tiger eats the cat.
stmt9 = solver.mkForall([person], solver.mkImplies(solver.mkAnd(eats(person, tiger), eats(person, cat)), eats(tiger, cat)))

# Other facts
stmt10 = eats(cat, mouse)
stmt11 = likes(cat, tiger)
stmt12 = eats(cow, tiger)
stmt13 = likes(cow, cat)
stmt14 = chases(mouse, cat)
stmt15 = chases(mouse, cow)
stmt16 = eats(mouse, tiger)
stmt17 = green(mouse)
stmt18 = round(mouse)
stmt19 = chases(tiger, cat)
stmt20 = eats(tiger, cow)
stmt21 = likes(tiger, mouse)

# Add all the statements to solver
statements = [stmt1, stmt2, stmt3, stmt4, stmt5, stmt6, stmt7, 
              stmt8, stmt9, stmt10, stmt11, stmt12, stmt13, 
              stmt14, stmt15, stmt16, stmt17, stmt18, stmt19,
              stmt20, stmt21]

for stmt in statements:
    solver.assertFormula(stmt)

# Test statement: The tiger is round.
test_stmt = round(tiger)

# Check the satisfiability of the test statement
result = solver.checkSatAssuming(test_stmt)

print(f"The statement 'The tiger is round' is: {result}")
```

This CVC5 Python code initializes a solver and sets up the persons, properties, and relations. Then, it translates each contextual statement into a logical formula and adds them to the solver. Finally, it checks whether the test statement "The tiger is round" is satisfied given the context. The result will tell us if the statement is satisfiable, and thus, whether the tiger is indeed round based on the other provided information.
