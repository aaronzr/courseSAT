                with smt core formulas, definitions of variables used in those formulas, which the
                smt solver tries to solve for, and relevant natural language requirements. Given the definitions of variables used in the formula: Below are definitions of variables in the solver formulas: 
```grade```: grade obtained in a required course meets letter grade
```course_a```: a required course in one of the three required breadth required areas has taken 
```course_b```: a required course in one of the three required breadth required areas has taken 
```course_c```: a required course in one of the three required breadth required areas has taken 
```course_a_units```: a taken course in a required area meets unit requirements
```course_b_units```: a taken course in a required area meets unit requirements
```course_c_units```: a taken course in a required area meets unit requirements

 and

The provided SMT formula can be translated into the following natural language requirements:

1. Three breadth courses must be taken, each from a different area among A, B, and C (or D if specified).

2. Each of these courses must meet the minimum unit requirement of 3 units:
   - Course from breadth area A must meet this requirement.
   - Course from breadth area B must meet this requirement.
   - Course from breadth area C must meet this requirement.

3. For each of these courses, specific grade conditions must be met:
   - If the course is "CME 100", "CS 106B":
     - It must have a minimum of 5 units.
     - It must be completed with a grade of "B" or better.
   - If the course is "CME 102", "CME 104":
     - It must have a minimum of 5 units.
     - It must be completed with a grade of "A-" or better.
   - If the course is "CME 106":
     - It must have a minimum of 4 units.
     - It must be completed with a grade of "B+" or better.
   - For all other courses mentioned, it must be graded based on a letter grade requirement, with letter grades ranging from "A+" to "F".

4. The available breadth areas and corresponding courses are specified:
   - Area A (Mathematical and Theoretical Foundations): Courses include "CS 154", "CS 157", "CS 168", "CS 254", "CS 261", "CS 265", "EE 364A", "EE 364B", "Phil 251".
   - Area B (Computer Systems): Courses include "CS 140", "CS 140E", "CS 143", "CS 144", "CS 149", "CS 212", "CS 242", "CS 243", "CS 244", "CS 244B", "CS 295", "CS 316", "CS 358", "EE 180", "EE 282", "EE 382E".
   - Area C (Applications): Courses include "CS 145", "CS 147", "CS 148", "CS 155", "CS 173", "CS 221", "CS 223A", "CS 224N", "CS 224U", "CS 224W", "CS 227B", "CS 228", "CS 229", "CS 229M", "CS 231A", "CS 231N", "CS 234", "CS 236", "CS 237A", "CS 245", "CS 246", "CS 247", "CS 248", "CS 248A", "CS 251", "CS 255", "CS 273A", "CS 273B", "CS 279", "CS 345", "CS 347", "CS 348A", "CS 348B", "CS 348C", "CS 348E", "CS 348I", "CS 348K", "CS 355", "CS 356", "CS 373".

5. Each of the three selected courses cannot be the same:
   - The selected course for area A must be different from the selected courses for areas B and C.
   - The selected course for area B must be different from the selected courses for areas A and C.
   - The selected course for area C must be different from the selected courses for areas A and B.

6. Flexibility in grading options is allowed:
   - Allowable grades include "A+", "A", "A-", "B+", "B", "B-", "C+", "C", "C-", "D+", "D", "D-", "F".

By combining these conditions, the requirements ensure that the student completes the breadth requirement with the correct distribution of courses, proper unit adherence, and validated letter grades.
