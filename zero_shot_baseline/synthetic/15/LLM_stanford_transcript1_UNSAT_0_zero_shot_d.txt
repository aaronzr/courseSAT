==================================================================GPT Answer to Prompt One Regarding BS Requirements====================
To determine if the student, Julian Mark Bergson, has met the requirements for the Bachelor of Science (BS) in Computer Science with an Artificial Intelligence (AI) track at Stanford University, let's analyze his transcript against the provided requirements.

**1. Core courses in Computer Science:**
   - **CS107/107E (Computer Organization and Systems)**: Not found in the transcript.
   - **CS111 (Operating Systems Principles)**: Julian has taken "CS 200 Operating System Concepts" which should cover CS111.
   - **CS161 (Design and Analysis of Algorithms)**: Not found in the transcript.

**2. Mathematics and Science Requirements:**
   - **Math (26 units minimum):**
     - **MATH 19 (Calculus), MATH 20, MATH 21**: Julian has AP credit for Calculus AB, but it covers only one course.
     - **CS 103 (Mathematical Foundations of Computing)**: Not found in the transcript.
     - **CS 109 (Introduction to Probability for Computer Scientists)**: Not found in the transcript.
     - Two electives: Julian has taken several Math and Statistics courses (MATH 50, STAT 110, MATH 70, MATH 112, MATH 130), but the required courses must be MATH 19/20/21.
   - **Science (11 units minimum):**
     - **PHYS 41 (Mechanics), PHYS 43 (Electricity and Magnetism)**: Julian may have taken equivalent physics courses, but we require more detail.
     - Science Elective: Several science courses have been taken (e.g., BIO 101, BIO 120).

**3. Engineering Fundamentals (10 units minimum):**
   - **CS106B (Programming Abstractions)**: Equivalent "CS106C Data Structures and Algorithms" was taken, but CS106C may not exactly equate to CS106B.
   - **ENGR 40M or 76:** Equivalent "ENGR 50C Dynamics in Engineering" and "ENGR 20 Sustainable Engineering Practices" were taken.

**4. Technology in Society Requirement:**
   - One course required from the Approved TiS list: The transcript lists various courses, but TiS approval is needed.

**5. Depth and Senior Project Requirement (43 units minimum):**
   - **CS221 (AI: Principles and Techniques)**: "CS 210 Introduction to AI" was taken.
   - Track Requirements:
     - **Track Requirement B**: To be determined based on provided list, but courses must be from different areas.
     - **Track Requirement C and Electives**: CS 260 (Machine Learning) and CS 199 (AI Capstone Project) are relevant.
   - **Senior Project (3 units minimum)**: "CS 199 AI Capstone Project" satisfies the senior project requirement.

**Overall GPA Requirement:**
   - A minimum GPA of 2.0 is required in the selected combined courses. Julian's overall GPA is 3.115.

**Summary of Requirements Not Satisfied:**
   - CS107/107E
   - CS161
   - CS103 and CS109
   - CS106B may not be satisfied if CS106C is not accepted.
   - Verification of science courses equivalents for PHYS 41 and PHYS 43, or studentâ€™s detailed terms regarding science courses taken.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of Julian's transcript, the following courses/requirements were found as not satisfied:
- CS107/107E (Computer Organization and Systems)
- CS161 (Design and Analysis of Algorithms)
- CS103 (Mathematical Foundations of Computing)
- CS109 (Introduction to Probability for Computer Scientists)
- CS106B (Programming Abstractions) if CS106C is not approved as replacement
- Technology in Society course verification required
- Science requirement (verification of Physics/Electives required)

### Output:
```
Courses not satisfied:
- CS107/107E
- CS161
- CS103
- CS109
- CS106B or equivalent must be verified
- Technology in Society requirement verification needed
- Physics and Science electives verification needed
```

Julian Mark Bergson's transcript does not meet all the BS Computer Science requirements as outlined.========================GPT Answer to Prompt Two Regarding MS Requirements====================
Based on the given transcript and the MS requirements for the Artificial Intelligence specialization in the MSCS program, let's carefully analyze the student's record to determine if all requirements are satisfied.

**FOUNDATIONS REQUIREMENT:**
- **Logic, Automata & Complexity (CS103)**: Not mentioned in the transcript.
- **Probability (CS109, Stat116, CME106, MS&E220, or EE178)**: Completed MATH 130 (Probability Theory) with a B- grade.
- **Algorithmic Analysis (CS161)**: Completed CS 250 (Advanced Algorithms) with a B- grade.
- **Computer Organ & Sys (CS107 or 107E)**: Not mentioned in the transcript.
- **Principles of Computer Systems (CS110 or CS111)**: Not mentioned in the transcript.

**SIGNIFICANT IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENT:**
- Courses that may satisfy this requirement include CS 140, 140E, 143, 144, 145, 148, 151, 190, 210B, 212, 221, 227B, 231N, 243, 248/248A, and 341. Here, there is no specific course from this list in the transcript explicitly marked for this requirement.

**BREADTH REQUIREMENT:**
- **Area A (Mathematical and Theoretical Foundations)**: Not specifically mentioned.
- **Area B (Computer Systems)**: CS 200 (Operating System Concepts).
- **Area C (Applications)**: CS 145 (Database Systems).
- **Area D (Computing and Society)**: Not specifically mentioned.

**ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE DEPTH:**
a) **CS 221 (students with equivalent course work may waive with adviser approval)**: Not mentioned in the transcript.
b) **At least four of: CS 223A, 224N, 224S, 224U, 224V, 224W, 228, 229, 231A, 231N, 234, 237A, 237B, 238**: Only CS 260 (Machine Learning) is completed.
c) **A total of at least 21 units from categories (a), (b) and the given list**: Completed CS 260 (Machine Learning) with 3 units.

**ELECTIVES:**
- Required completion of the remaining units for the 45-unit requirement:
  - CS 199: AI Capstone Project (5 units, B)
  - Other courses are general without specific details in the MS requirements compliance bracket.

**Additional Requirements:**
- At least 36 units taken for a letter grade: Total grades taken generally meet this.
- All courses listed are above 100.
- Units counted towards the undergrad degree may not be counted again.

### Summary:
Julian Bergson still needs to complete several specific requirements to satisfy the MS in AI specialization:

- Foundations: CS 103, CS 107/107E, CS 110.
- Breadth: One more course from Area A and Area D.
- Depth courses: Must complete a total of 21 units including a variety of specified AI-related courses.
- Significant Implementation requirement: Needs a specific mutually acceptable course marked for this requirement.

### Courses Not Satisfied:

1. CS 103 (Logic, Automata & Complexity)
2. CS 107/107E (Computer Organ & Sys)
3. CS 110 (Principles of Computer Systems)
4. A course from Area A (Mathematical and Theoretical Foundations)
5. A course from Area D (Computing and Society)
6. A total 21 depth unit requirement related to AI courses
7. Significant Implementation Requirement completion

Therefore, the output is:

"MS requirements not satisfied. Courses missing: CS 103, CS 107/107E, CS 110, A course from Area A, A course from Area D, AI depth course units (21 units), and a course fulfilling the Significant Implementation Requirement."
