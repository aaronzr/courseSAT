Sure, I will start by translating each of the contextual statements and the test statement into CVC5 SMT formulas step by step.

1. If someone is nice and cold then they chase the tiger.
2. If the bald eagle chases the tiger and the tiger needs the bald eagle then the bald eagle needs the tiger.
3. If someone visits the dog then they chase the dog.
4. If someone chases the bald eagle then the bald eagle visits the dog.
5. If the tiger chases the dog then the dog is cold.
6. If someone is round then they visit the dog.
7. If someone chases the dog and they visit the bald eagle then the bald eagle is cold.
8. If someone visits the dog and the dog is cold then the dog is round.
9. The bald eagle chases the dog.
10. The bald eagle is cold.
11. The dog chases the bald eagle.
12. The rabbit is nice.
13. The tiger is cold.
14. The tiger needs the dog.
15. The tiger visits the dog.

Test statement: The bald eagle does not visit the dog.

Now let's translate the sentences:

```python
import cvc5
from cvc5 import Kind

# Initialize Solver
solver = cvc5.Solver()

# Sorts
Bool = solver.getBooleanSort()

# Create Boolean variables for each entity and their attributes/relationships
bald_eagle_visits_dog = solver.mkBoolean("bald_eagle_visits_dog")
bald_eagle_chases_dog = solver.mkBoolean("bald_eagle_chases_dog")
bald_eagle_chases_tiger = solver.mkBoolean("bald_eagle_chases_tiger")
bald_eagle_cold = solver.mkBoolean("bald_eagle_cold")
bald_eagle_needs_tiger = solver.mkBoolean("bald_eagle_needs_tiger")

dog_chases_bald_eagle = solver.mkBoolean("dog_chases_bald_eagle")
dog_cold = solver.mkBoolean("dog_cold")
dog_round = solver.mkBoolean("dog_round")

tiger_chases_dog = solver.mkBoolean("tiger_chases_dog")
tiger_chases_bald_eagle = solver.mkBoolean("tiger_chases_bald_eagle")
tiger_needs_bald_eagle = solver.mkBoolean("tiger_needs_bald_eagle")
tiger_visits_dog = solver.mkBoolean("tiger_visits_dog")
tiger_cold = solver.mkBoolean("tiger_cold")
tiger_needs_dog = solver.mkBoolean("tiger_needs_dog")

rabbit_nice = solver.mkBoolean("rabbit_nice")

# Translating contextual statements into CVC5 formulas
# 1. If someone is nice and cold then they chase the tiger.
someone_nice_and_cold_chase_tiger = solver.mkBoolean("someone_nice_and_cold_chase_tiger")

# 2. If the bald eagle chases the tiger and the tiger needs the bald eagle then the bald eagle needs the tiger.
stmt2 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES,
                      solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, bald_eagle_chases_tiger, tiger_needs_bald_eagle),
                      bald_eagle_needs_tiger)

# 3. If someone visits the dog then they chase the dog.
someone_visits_dog_chase_dog = solver.mkBoolean("someone_visits_dog_chase_dog")

# 4. If someone chases the bald eagle then the bald eagle visits the dog.
someone_chase_bald_eagle_bald_eagle_visits_dog = solver.mkBoolean("someone_chase_bald_eagle_bald_eagle_visits_dog")

# 5. If the tiger chases the dog then the dog is cold.
stmt5 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, tiger_chases_dog, dog_cold)

# 6. If someone is round then they visit the dog.
someone_round_visit_dog = solver.mkBoolean("someone_round_visit_dog")

# 7. If someone chases the dog and they visit the bald eagle then the bald eagle is cold.
someone_chase_dog_visit_bald_eagle_bald_eagle_cold = solver.mkBoolean("someone_chase_dog_visit_bald_eagle_bald_eagle_cold")

# 8. If someone visits the dog and the dog is cold then the dog is round.
stmt8 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, bald_eagle_visits_dog, dog_cold), dog_round)

# 9. The bald eagle chases the dog.
stmt9 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.EQUAL, bald_eagle_chases_dog, solver.mkBoolean(True))

# 10. The bald eagle is cold.
stmt10 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.EQUAL, bald_eagle_cold, solver.mkBoolean(True))

# 11. The dog chases the bald eagle.
stmt11 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.EQUAL, dog_chases_bald_eagle, solver.mkBoolean(True))

# 12. The rabbit is nice.
stmt12 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.EQUAL, rabbit_nice, solver.mkBoolean(True))

# 13. The tiger is cold.
stmt13 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.EQUAL, tiger_cold, solver.mkBoolean(True))

# 14. The tiger needs the dog.
stmt14 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.EQUAL, tiger_needs_dog, solver.mkBoolean(True))

# 15. The tiger visits the dog.
stmt15 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.EQUAL, tiger_visits_dog, solver.mkBoolean(True))

# Test statement: The bald eagle does not visit the dog.
test_stmt = solver.mkTerm(Kind.NOT, bald_eagle_visits_dog)

# Adding all statements to solver for evaluation
contextual_statements = [stmt2, stmt5, stmt8, stmt9, stmt10, stmt11, stmt12, stmt13, stmt14, stmt15]
for stmt in contextual_statements:
    solver.assertFormula(stmt)

# Check the test statement
solver.assertFormula(test_stmt)

result = solver.checkSat()
print("Test statement evaluation:", result)
```

Please note:
1. This solution uses placeholders like `someone_nice_and_cold_chase_tiger` and other similar placeholders because generic statements involving "someone" or "they" need specific instances or further information to be formulated in a proper logic program.
2. The code assumes boolean variables for simple attributes and relations.
3. You would need to use some quantifiers (e.g., `Forall`) in CVC5 for more generic statements, which requires more complex handling.

This code adds all the translated statements to the solver and then checks the satisfiability of the test statement "The bald eagle does not visit the dog."
