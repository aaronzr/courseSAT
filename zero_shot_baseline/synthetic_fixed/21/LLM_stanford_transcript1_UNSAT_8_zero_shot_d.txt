==================================================================GPT Answer to Prompt One Regarding BS Requirements====================
Based on the Bachelor in Science (BS) degree requirements for the Computer Science program at Stanford as provided, I'll analyze Amanda Marie Johnson's transcript to determine whether all the requirements are satisfied.

### BS Core Requirements
1. **ENGR Fundamentals and CS Core**
    - A minimum GPA of 2.0 for all courses in ENGR Fundamentals and CS Core, Depth, and Senior Project combined.
    - Required courses:

        - CS109: Introduction to Probability for Computer Scientists - Taken, Grade: B+ (5 units)
    - Electives needed - 2 additional math electives from the provided list - Not found

3. **Science Requirements (11 units minimum)**
    - Courses taken:
        - PHYS 41: Mechanics - Taken, Grade: A- (4 units)
        - PHYS 44: Electricity and Magnetism Lab - Taken, Grade: S (1 unit)
        - Elective needed - Additional elective from the provided list - Not found

4. **Technology in Society (1 course)**
    - Not found

5. **Senior Project (minimum one course)**
    - Options include courses like CS191, CS194, CS194W, CS210B, or CS294 - Not found

6. **CS Depth Requirements for AI Track (43 units minimum)**
    - Core courses:
        - **CS107: Computer Organization and Systems** - Taken, Grade: C
        - **CS111: Principles of Computer Systems** - Not found
        - **CS161: Design and Analysis of Algorithms** - Taken, Grade: D (Needs to be retaken)
    - AI Track Requirement A:
        - **CS221: AI: Principles and Techniques** - Not found
    - AI Track Requirement B (2 courses, different areas):
        - **CS223A: Robotics** - Taken, Grade: B
        - **CS222: Natural Language Processing** - Taken, Grade: B
    - AI Track Requirement C (additional course from Track B or C list):
        - No additional course from Track B or C list found
    - Electives (3 additional courses from Track B, C, General CS Electives):
        - **CS248: Game Design** - Taken, Grade: A
        - **CS270: Computational Biology** - Taken, Grade: A
        - **CS331: Advanced Machine Learning** - Taken, Grade: A-

### Summary of Missing Requirements:
1. **CS111: Principles of Computer Systems**
2. **CS161: Data Structures and Algorithms** (Retake needed)
3. **Two Math Electives from approved list**
4. **One Science Elective from approved list**
5. **Technology in Society Course**
6. **Senior Project Course**
7. **CS221: AI: Principles and Techniques**
8. **One Additional Course from AI Track Requirement C list**
9. **Minimum GPA Verification for combined courses**

**Conclusion:**
Based on the above analysis, Amanda Marie Johnson's transcript does **not** satisfy all the BS requirements for the Computer Science program.
Therefore, the output is a list of courses not satisfied:
- CS111: Principles of Computer Systems
- CS161: Data Structures and Algorithms (Retake needed for higher grade)
- Two Math Electives from approved list
- One Science Elective from approved list
- Technology in Society Course
- Senior Project Course
- CS221: AI: Principles and Techniques
- One Additional Course from AI Track Requirement C list

```plaintext
CS111, CS161 (retake), two math electives, one science elective, Technology in Society Course, Senior Project Course, CS221, one additional course from AI Track Requirement C list
```========================GPT Answer to Prompt Two Regarding MS Requirements====================
To determine if Amanda Marie Johnson satisfies the MSCS degree requirements with an Artificial Intelligence Specialization, we need to cross-check her courses and grades against the detailed requirements.

  - Must check total units later after matching other requirements.

### Additional Requirements Check:
- All courses numbered 100 or greater: Yes
- Maximum 10 units for Foundations towards 45 units: Yes
- Maximum 3 units of 1-2 unit seminars: Yes
- At least 36 units for letter grade (except specific CR requirements due to COVID): Yes
- Average grade at least B (3.0): Graduate GPA: 3.740
- Units previously applied towards BS not counted: Review confirms no such overlap for key required courses
- At least 45 graduate units at Stanford: Not met yet, only 32 units accrued

### Courses Not Satisfied:
1. **Algorithmic Analysis (CS161)**
   - Grade D, not sufficient
2. **Principles of Computer Systems (CS110 or CS111)** not completed
3. **Breadth Requirement:**
   - Area A, B, D **not satisfied**.
4. **Artificial Intelligence Depth:**
   - CS 221 not completed
   - At least three more Depth courses from specified list not completed
   - Total Depth units relevaltly accrued = 10 units
5. **Total graduate units:** Only 32 out of 45 required.
