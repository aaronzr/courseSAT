Here's how each statement can be translated into CVC5 python formulas. 

We'll define the following predicates:
- `eats(a, b)`: Means `a` eats `b`
- `young(a)`: Means `a` is young
- `visits(a, b)`: Means `a` visits `b`
- `sees(a, b)`: Means `a` sees `b`
- `kind(a)`: Means `a` is kind
- `big(a)`: Means `a` is big
- `red(a)`: Means `a` is red

We'll also use quantifiers for the statements involving "someone," indicating any entity in the domain.

Let's start translating the contextual and test statements.

1. If the cow eats the tiger then the cow is young.
    ```python
    solver.assert_formula(implies(eats(cow, tiger), young(cow)))
    ```
    
2. If someone eats the bear and they visit the mouse then the bear is young.
    ```python
    solver.assert_formula(forall([x], implies(and(eats(x, bear), visits(x, mouse)), young(bear))))
    ```
    
3. If someone eats the mouse then they eat the bear.
    ```python
    solver.assert_formula(forall([x], implies(eats(x, mouse), eats(x, bear))))
    ```
    
4. If someone is young then they visit the mouse.
    ```python
    solver.assert_formula(forall([x], implies(young(x), visits(x, mouse))))
    ```
    
5. If someone visits the cow then the cow eats the tiger.
    ```python
    solver.assert_formula(forall([x], implies(visits(x, cow), eats(cow, tiger))))
    ```
    
6. If the tiger visits the mouse then the tiger sees the cow.
    ```python
    solver.assert_formula(implies(visits(tiger, mouse), sees(tiger, cow)))
    ```

7. If someone is kind and they eat the tiger then they see the cow.
    ```python
    solver.assert_formula(forall([x], implies(and(kind(x), eats(x, tiger)), sees(x, cow))))
    ```
    
8. The bear eats the mouse.
    ```python
    solver.assert_formula(eats(bear, mouse))
    ```
    
9. The bear sees the mouse.
    ```python
    solver.assert_formula(sees(bear, mouse))
    ```
    
10. The cow eats the bear.
    ```python
    solver.assert_formula(eats(cow, bear))
    ```
    
11. The cow is red.
    ```python
    solver.assert_formula(red(cow))
    ```
    
12. The cow sees the mouse.
    ```python
    solver.assert_formula(sees(cow, mouse))
    ```
    
13. The cow sees the tiger.
    ```python
    solver.assert_formula(sees(cow, tiger))
    ```
    
14. The mouse sees the cow.
    ```python
    solver.assert_formula(sees(mouse, cow))
    ```
    
15. The mouse visits the cow.
    ```python
    solver.assert_formula(visits(mouse, cow))
    ```
    
16. The tiger eats the mouse.
    ```python
    solver.assert_formula(eats(tiger, mouse))
    ```
    
17. The tiger is big.
    ```python
    solver.assert_formula(big(tiger))
    ```
    
18. The tiger sees the bear.
    ```python
    solver.assert_formula(sees(tiger, bear))
    ```
    
19. The tiger sees the cow.
    ```python
    solver.assert_formula(sees(tiger, cow))
    ```

Test statement: The bear eats the bear.
    ```python
    test_statement = eats(bear, bear)
    ```

Now, we'll create a CVC5 script to check whether the test statement is satisfiable given the constraints.

```python
import cvc5
from cvc5 import Kind

# Create a solver
solver = cvc5.Solver()
solver.setOption("produce-models", "true")

# Define sorts
Animal = solver.getStringSort()

# Define animals
cow = solver.mkConst(Animal, "cow")
tiger = solver.mkConst(Animal, "tiger")
bear = solver.mkConst(Animal, "bear")
mouse = solver.mkConst(Animal, "mouse")
x = solver.mkVar(Animal, "x")

# Define predicates
eats = solver.mkPredicate([Animal, Animal], "eats")
young = solver.mkPredicate([Animal], "young")
visits = solver.mkPredicate([Animal, Animal], "visits")
sees = solver.mkPredicate([Animal, Animal], "sees")
kind = solver.mkPredicate([Animal], "kind")
big = solver.mkPredicate([Animal], "big")
red = solver.mkPredicate([Animal], "red")

# Add constraints
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, eats(cow, tiger), young(cow)))
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(Kind.FORALL, x, solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, eats(x, bear), visits(x, mouse)), young(bear))))
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(Kind.FORALL, x, solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, eats(x, mouse), eats(x, bear))))
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(Kind.FORALL, x, solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, young(x), visits(x, mouse))))
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(Kind.FORALL, x, solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, visits(x, cow), eats(cow, tiger))))
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, visits(tiger, mouse), sees(tiger, cow)))
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(Kind.FORALL, x, solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, kind(x), eats(x, tiger)), sees(x, cow))))
solver.assertFormula(eats(bear, mouse))
solver.assertFormula(sees(bear, mouse))
solver.assertFormula(eats(cow, bear))
solver.assertFormula(red(cow))
solver.assertFormula(sees(cow, mouse))
solver.assertFormula(sees(cow, tiger))
solver.assertFormula(sees(mouse, cow))
solver.assertFormula(visits(mouse, cow))
solver.assertFormula(eats(tiger, mouse))
solver.assertFormula(big(tiger))
solver.assertFormula(sees(tiger, bear))
solver.assertFormula(sees(tiger, cow))

# Define the test statement
test_statement = eats(bear, bear)

# Check satisfiability
solver.push()
solver.assertFormula(test_statement)
result = solver.checkSat()
solver.pop()

# Output the result
print("Test statement is", result)
```

This script prepares the context and checks the satisfiability of the test statement using the CVC5 solver.
