    - PHYS 44: Classical Mechanics Lab (1 unit)
    - PHYS 81: Electricity and Magnetism Lab (1 unit)
    - PHYS 45: Light and Heat (4 units)

    **Total Science Units:** 14 units.

3. **Technology in Society Requirement**: No course listed. Possible deficiency.
4. **Engineering Fundamentals (10 units minimum)**:

    - CS228: Machine Learning Theory (3 units, Area I)
    - CS234: Reinforcement Learning (3 units, Track Requirement C)
    - CS245: Database Systems Principles (3 units, Elective)
    - PHIL 151: Metalogic (3 units, Elective)
    - CS257: Logic and Automated Reasoning (3 units, Elective)
    - CS270: Computational Genomics (3 units, Depth Elective)
    - CS231A: Computer Vision (3 units, Area III)
    - CS371: Computational Neural Models (3 units, Elective)

    **Total Depth Units:** 36 units (minimum 25 required).

### Conclusion
- **Technological in Society Requirement:** Not satisfied.
Thus, the conclusion is:

**NOT SATISFIED**.

Missing Requirement:
- **Technology in Society Requirement:** This requirement course is not specified in the transcript.

Please note: All other requirements, including overall GPA and course units, are satisfied based on the transcript.========================GPT Answer to Prompt Two Regarding MS Requirements====================
To determine if Alexandra Smith's transcript satisfies the requirements for the MS degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence, we need to verify that all the outlined requirements are met:

### Foundations Requirement
1. **Logic, Automata & Complexity (CS103)**  
   - Taken: **CS 103** - **Grade: B**
2. **Probability (CS109, Stat116, CME106, MS&E220, or EE178)**  
   - Taken: **CS 109** - **Grade: B+**
3. **Algorithmic Analysis (CS161)**  
   - Taken: **CS 161** - **Grade: A-**
4. **Computer Organization & Systems (CS107 or 107E)**  
   - Taken: **CS 107** - **Grade: B**
5. **Principles of Computer Systems (CS110 or CS111)**  
   - Taken: **CS 111** - **Grade: B+**

**TOTAL UNITS USED TO SATISFY FOUNDATIONS REQUIREMENT: 25 units**  
(Note: This doesn't exceed the maximum allowable 10 units for Foundations requirement toward the 45 units needed for MS.)

### Significant Implementation Requirement
- **CS 245 Database Systems Principles** (Taken in 2022-2023 Spring)
  - This course fulfills the Significant Implementation requirement with a grade of **B+**.

### Breadth Requirement
1. **Area A - Mathematical and Theoretical Foundations**:
   - **CS 257 Logic and Automated Reasoning** - **Grade: A**
2. **Area B - Computer Systems**:
   - **CS 111 Operating Systems Principles** - **Grade: B+**
3. **Area C - Applications**:
   - **CS 221 AI: Principles and Techniques** - **Grade: A**

### Artificial Intelligence Depth Requirement
1. **CS 221 AI: Principles and Techniques** - **Grade: A-** (required course)
2. Four of the following:
   - **CS 223A Introduction to Robotics** - **Grade: A**
   - **CS 224N Natural Language Processing** - **Grade: B+**
   - **CS 228 Machine Learning Theory** - **Grade: B+**
   - **CS 234 Reinforcement Learning** - **Grade: A**

**Total Depth Units Applied to MSCS:**   
   - **CS 221** - 3 units
   - **CS 223A** - 3 units
   - **CS 224N** - 3 units
   - **CS 228** - 3 units
   - **CS 234** - 3 units
   - **CS 245** - 3 units (CS 245 is also depth and bread)

Depth Units total 18 units from counted depth courses, plus CS 285 (HCI and Software Engineering) 3 units, CS 246 (Mining Massive Datasets) 3 units, and CS 231A (Computer Vision) 3 units. Together, these course units provide a satisfactory total in excess of 21 units.

### Electives (Beyond the required 45 units total)
- **PHIL 151 Metalogic** - 3 units
- **PHIL 152 Metaphysics** - 3 units
- **PHYSICS 45 Light and Heat** - 4 units

### Additional Requirements Compliance
- **All courses numbered 100 or greater**: ✔
- **At least 36 units for letter grade**: ✔
- **Average grade must be at least B (3.0)**: ✔ (since cumulative GPA is 3.631)
- **Completion of 45 graduate units at Stanford**: ✔

Based on the evidence from Alexandra Smith's transcript, it appears she meets all the requirements for the MS degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence.

Therefore, the output is:
**MS SAT**
