                with smt core formulas and definitions of variables used in those formulas, which the
                smt solver tries to solve for. Given the definitions of variables used in the formula: Below are definitions of variables in the solver formulas: 
```course_a```: a course in the Logic, Automata & Complexity cateogry is taken 
```course_b```: a course in the probability category is taken 
```course_c```: a course in the algorithmic analysis category is taken 
```course_d```: a course in the computer organ & sys category is taken 
```course_e```: a course in the principles of computer system is taken 
```course_a_units```: united earned of taken course in the Logic, Automata & Complexity cateogry
```course_b_units```: united earned of taken course in the probability category
```course_c_units```: united earned of taken course in the algorithmic analysis category
```course_d_units```: united earned of taken course in the computer organ & sys category
```course_e_units```: united earned of taken course in the principles of computer system
```total_units_var```: total units earned for foundations requirement

The statement specifies conditions and constraints for selecting courses and their unit requirements. Here's the natural language translation of the given SMT formulas:

1. Courses `course_a`, `course_b`, `course_c`, `course_d`, and `course_e` each belong to different categories and have specific unit requirements.
2. The units for `course_a`, `course_b`, `course_c`, `course_d`, and `course_e` must each be 5 units.
3. Additionally, `course_a`, `course_b`, `course_c`, `course_d`, and `course_e` are assigned unit values and course names, with specific conditions for which courses can equal 4 units.
4. The list of possible courses for `course_a`, `course_b`, `course_c`, `course_d`, and `course_e` includes the following: `CME 100`, `CME 102`, `CME 104`, `CS 106B`, and `CME 106`. If any of these courses are `CME 106`, their unit value is 4.
5. The total units earned from all courses (sum of units from `course_a`, `course_b`, `course_c`, `course_d`, and `course_e`) cannot exceed 10 units.
6. `course_a` specifically can be any of the following courses: `CS 103`, `CS109`, `Stat116`, `CME106`, `MS&E220`, `EE178`, `CS161`, `CS107`, `CS107E`, `CS110`, `CS111`, and none of these can be `None`.
 
Overall, the conditions prioritize ensuring that certain courses are taken while not exceeding the total unit limit of 10 units for all the courses combined.
