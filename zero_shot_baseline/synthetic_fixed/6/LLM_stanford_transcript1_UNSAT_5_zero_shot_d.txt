```========================GPT Answer to Prompt Two Regarding MS Requirements====================
Based on the provided transcript of Alexandra Marie Jordan, the following analysis examines whether the student satisfies the MS in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence at Stanford University.

### Foundations Requirement:
1. **Logic, Automata & Complexity (CS103)**:
   - Not found on the transcript.
   
2. **Probability (CS109, Stat116, CME106, MS&E220, or EE178)**:
   - Not found on the transcript.
   
3. **Algorithmic Analysis (CS161)**:
   - Not found on the transcript.
   
4. **Computer Org & Sys (CS107 or 107E)**:
   - Not found on the transcript.

5. **Principles of Computer Systems (CS110 or CS111)**:
   - Not found on the transcript.

### Significant Implementation Requirement:
- **Course Number**: Not found on the transcript.
- Courses that may be used include: CS140, 140E, 143, 144, 145, 148, 151, 190, 210B, 212, 221, 227B, 231N, 243, 248/248A, and 341.
   - None of these courses found on the transcript.

### Breadth Requirement:
Three courses, each from areas A, B, C, or D must be taken for at least 3 units each and for a letter grade.

- **Area A (Mathematical and Theoretical Foundations)**: 
  - None of the specified courses found on the transcript.
  
- **Area B (Computer Systems)**: 
  - None of the specified courses found on the transcript.

- **Area C (Applications)**: 
  - None of the specified courses found on the transcript.
  
- **Area D (Computing and Society)**: 
  - None of the specified courses found on the transcript.

### Artificial Intelligence Depth Requirement:
1. **CS 221**:
   - Not found on the transcript (waiver also not mentioned).
   
2. **At least 4 of the following**:
   - CS223A, 224N, 224S, 224U, 224V, 224W, 228, 229, 231A, 231N, 234, 237A, 237B, 238:

   - None of the additional specified courses found on the transcript.

### Electives:
- No electives relevant to the MS in Computer Science and specialization requirements found on the transcript.

### Grade and Unit Requirements:
- **Average Grade**: The transcript shows a cumulative graduate GPA of 3.575, which is above the required 3.0.
- **Total Graduate Units**: Only 37.00 graduate units found, while at least 45 graduate units are required.

### Summary
Jordan, Alexandra Marie's transcript does not satisfy the MS in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence requirements. The unsatisfied requirements are:

1. Logic, Automata & Complexity (CS103)
2. Probability (CS109, Stat116, CME106, MS&E220, or EE178)
3. Algorithmic Analysis (CS161)
4. Computer Org & Sys (CS107 or 107E)
5. Principles of Computer Systems (CS110 or CS111)
6. Significant Implementation Requirement
7. Breadth Requirement (Areas A, B, C, D)
8. CS 221 (or waiver not mentioned)
9. Four courses from the specified list of AI Depth courses
10. A total of at least 21 units from categories (a), (b), and additional specified courses
11. Graduate units required for MS degree (45 graduate units)

Therefore, the output is:

```MS NOT SATISFIED```

List of courses not satisfied:
- Logic, Automata & Complexity (CS103)
- Probability (CS109, Stat116, CME106, MS&E220, or EE178)
