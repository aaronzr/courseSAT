        Your task is to generate cvc5 python solver formulas for the constraints in each requirement ELECTIVES

List here any additional courses used to complete the 45-unit requirement for the MSCS degree. You may count up to a maximum of 3 units of 1-2 unit seminars offered in the School of Engineering. All other electives must be taken for 3 or more units. CS courses numbered above 111, excluding CS196, CS198, and CS390A/B/C, can be used as MS electives. Non-CS courses must be technical courses numbered above 100, related to the degree program, and approved by the adviser and the MS program administrator. Note that CS 129 may not be counted towards the MS if CS 229 is being counted towards any BS or MS requirement.

. You should also include
        solver formulas for advisor approval and deviation constraints if there is one. Please note that your formulas should check taken courses in the transcript against each contraint and requirement. Please generate

        =======================formula ouput===========================
To address the provided requirements for MSCS electives using the cvc5 Python solver, we should first understand the constraints and then model them as cvc5 SMT formulas. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Constraint Analysis**:
    - **Total Units Requirement**: Total units of elective courses must sum to at least 45.
    - **Seminars Limit**: Only up to 3 units from 1-2 unit seminars in the School of Engineering can be counted towards the electives.
    - **CS Courses**: Must be numbered above 111 (excludes CS196, CS198, and CS390A/B/C).
    - **Non-CS Courses**: Must be technical, numbered above 100, and approved by the advisor and MS program administrator.
    - **Special Case**: CS 129 cannot be counted if CS 229 is counted towards BS or MS requirements.

2. **Schema Input Variables**: Provided transcript JSON format includes essential fields about the courses taken, deviations, approvals, and overall GPA.

3. **Parameterized cvc5 Solver Formulas**: Generate constraints to verify the transcript against MSCS electives requirements.

Here is the code representing these constraints in cvc5:

```python
