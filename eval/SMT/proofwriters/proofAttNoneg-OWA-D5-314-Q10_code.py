To translate the given contextual statements and the test statement into CVC5 SMT Python formulas, we first need to set up a script that uses cvc5's Python API. We'll define predicates for the different properties and individuals mentioned in the statements. Hereâ€™s how we can approach it:

1. Define predicates for properties: `Young`, `Red`, `Smart`, `Rough`, `Cold`, `Kind`, and `Blue`.
2. Define constants for individuals: `Harry`, `Gary`, `Anne`, `Bob`.
3. Translate each statement into a logical formula.

Let's begin:

```python
import cvc5

# Create a CVC5 Solver instance
solver = cvc5.Solver()

# Define sorts
Bool = solver.getBoolSort()

# Define predicates
Young = solver.mkConst(Bool, 'Young')
Red = solver.mkConst(Bool, 'Red')
Smart = solver.mkConst(Bool, 'Smart')
Rough = solver.mkConst(Bool, 'Rough')
Cold = solver.mkConst(Bool, 'Cold')
Kind = solver.mkConst(Bool, 'Kind')
Blue = solver.mkConst(Bool, 'Blue')

# Define individuals
Harry = solver.mkConst(Bool, 'Harry')
Gary = solver.mkConst(Bool, 'Gary')
Anne = solver.mkConst(Bool, 'Anne')
Bob = solver.mkConst(Bool, 'Bob')

# Create variables
x = solver.mkVar(Bool, 'x')

# Statements translated into CVC5 formulas
all_young_red = solver.mkForall([x], solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.IMPLIES, Young, Red))  # All young things are red
harry_young_smart = solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.IMPLIES, Young, Smart)  # If Harry is young then Harry is smart
gary_rough_cold = solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.IMPLIES, Rough, Cold)  # If Gary is rough then Gary is cold
gary_cold_blue_rough = solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.AND, Cold, Blue), Rough)  # If Gary is cold and Gary is blue then Gary is rough
smart_kind_young = solver.mkForall([x], solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.AND, Smart, Kind), Young))  # If something is smart and kind then it is young
all_cold_smart = solver.mkForall([x], solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.IMPLIES, Cold, Smart))  # All cold things are smart
kind_rough = solver.mkForall([x], solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.IMPLIES, Kind, Rough))  # If something is kind then it is rough
red_kind_cold = solver.mkForall([x], solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.AND, Red, Kind), Cold))  # Red, kind things are cold
anne_cold = Cold  # Anne is cold
anne_smart = Smart  # Anne is smart
bob_smart = Smart  # Bob is smart
bob_young = Young  # Bob is young
gary_kind = Kind  # Gary is kind
harry_red = Red  # Harry is red
harry_young = Young  # Harry is young

# Add formulas to solver
formulas = [
    all_young_red,
    harry_young_smart,
    gary_rough_cold,
    gary_cold_blue_rough,
    smart_kind_young,
    all_cold_smart,
    kind_rough,
    red_kind_cold,
    anne_cold,
    anne_smart,
    bob_smart,
    bob_young,
    gary_kind,
    harry_red,
    harry_young
]

for formula in formulas:
    solver.assertFormula(formula)

# Test statement: Gary is not young
test_statement = solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.NOT, Young)

# Check if the test statement can be satisfied
check_result = solver.checkSatAssuming(test_statement)
print(check_result)
```

**Note:** This is to give an idea of how to structure and use the SMT solver with the sentences. However, cvc5 is typically used in a more symbolic approach where the properties (like `Young(x)`, `Red(x)`) and individuals are clearly defined. Adjustments may be needed based on detailed API references and specific syntax requirements of `cvc5`.

This code sets up the constraints and then checks whether the statement "Gary is not young" is satisfiable under these constraints. If results are not as expected, further refinement will be necessary by outlining the properties and relationships more explicitly.
