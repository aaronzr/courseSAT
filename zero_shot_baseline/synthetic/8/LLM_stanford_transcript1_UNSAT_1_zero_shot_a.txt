- MATH19/20/21 (10 units AP credit from Calculus AB).
- CS103 Mathematical Foundations of Computing (Taken as indicated in the depth requirement).
- CS109 Introduction to Probability for Computer Scientists (Taken as indicated in the core requirement).
- Mathematics Unit Total: Need to verify additional electives to reach 26 units.

#### Science Requirements (11 units minimum)

- Additional courses (e.g., BIO102, BIO201).

#### Engineering Fundamentals (10 units minimum)

- Courses such as ENGR 10 (Introduction to Engineering) taken (Grade: B).
- CS106B not listed explicitly.

#### Technology in Society Requirement

- Not explicitly mentioned in the transcript, needs verification.

#### Senior Project Requirement (1 course required)

- Senior project courses are not identified in the transcript explicitly (e.g., CS191/W, CS194, CS210B).

### AI Track Core, Depth, Electives Requirement (43 units minimum)

1. **Core (15 units minimum)**
   - CS107 or CS107E (Addressed earlier).
   - CS111 (CS202 considered as equivalent; Grade: B-).

2. **AI Track Depth (21 units minimum)**
   - CS221 (AI: Principles and Techniques, not listed).

   **Depth Courses (4 minimum)**
   - Taken courses:
     - CS306 (Artificial Intelligence, Grade: A+).
     - CS307 (Natural Language Processing, Grade: B+).
     - CS401 (Advanced Machine Learning, 2022-2023, Grade: B-).
   - Needs additional depth courses.

3. **Electives (3 additional courses)**
   - Various electives in relevant areas (multiple BIO, MATH, PHYS, and other relevant courses).
   - Senior Project not identified explicitly in transcript.

### Results for BS 

1. Core Requirements:
   - CS106B: Not listed.
   - CS107 equivalent: Addressed.
   - CS111: Addressed.
   - CS161: Addressed.

   **BS Core Requirements: Partially satisfied, CS106B missing**

2. Math Requirements:
   - Verified partially but needs detailed review of total 26 units.

3. Science Requirements:
   - Satisfied.

4. Engineering Fundamentals:
   - CS106B missing.

5. Technology in Society:
   - Not verifiable from transcript.

6. Senior Project:
   - Not explicitly identified on transcript.

7. AI Track Courses and Electives:
   - Some courses satisfied, additional depth and elective courses need to be reviewed.

### Status:
- **BS NOT SAT** due to missing CS106B, Technology in Society, and Senior Project.

### Master's Degree (MS) Analysis

1. **Foundations Requirement**
   - Logic, Automata & Complexity (CS103 not listed).
   - Probability (CS109 equivalent).
   - Algorithmic Analysis (CS161 equivalent).
   - Computer Organization & Systems (CS107).
   - Principles of Computer Systems (CS111).

2. **Breadth Requirement:**
   - Breadth course selection not explicitly detailed but AI-specific courses like CS306, CS307 taken.

3. **AI Depth Requirement:**
   - Verified some courses but need at least 21 units from specified list. Many components need verifications and total units calculation.

4. **Electives to fulfill 45 units:**
   - Need additional details; total credits, and confirmation for significant implementation course.

5. **Other Requirements:**
   - Confirmed units taken/total.
   - Significant implementation specifics needed.

### Status:
- **MS NOT SAT** as several AI Depth and elective requirements need verification and specific courses documented.

### Conclusion:

Review needed for specific missing courses, total units calculation, and in-depth verification on senior project and depth electives for both BS and MS.
