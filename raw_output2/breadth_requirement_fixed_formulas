        Please optimize your generated solver formulas by minimizing the use of
        for loops or if condition checks. The following example is an okay format, because we use a variable in the formula
        to parameterize the formulas as input to the solver: 
        ```python
        variable = solver.mkConst(solver.getStringSort(), "course")
        constraint_1 = [solver.mkTerm(Kind.EQUAL, solver.mkString(course.get("Course_ID")), solver.mkString(variable)) for course in transcript.get("Courses_Taken", [])]
        constraint_2 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.EQUAL, solver.mkString(variable), solver.mkString("CS 221"))
        formula = solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, constraint_1, constraint_2)
        ```
        The following example is NOT an okay format, because the formula is using hard coded values and is NOT parameterized: 
        ```python 
        for course in transcript.get("Courses_Taken", []):
                cs_221 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.EQUAL, solver.mkString(course.get("Course_ID")), solver.mkString("CS 221"))
        ```
        Please check the following out and convert for loops and if conditional checks into 
        solver formulas when possible: =======================prompt===========================

        Your task is to generate cvc5 python solver formulas for the constraints in each requirement BREADTH REQUIREMENT:

        When generating parameterized cvc5 solver formulas, please instantiate new variables to check the transcript schema against each constraint in the BREADTH REQUIREMENT. You should also include
        solver formulas for advisor approval and deviation constraints if there is one. Please note that not all taken couses in the transcript satisfy the given requierments. Please generate
        parameterized formulas with respect to the requirements only.

In this script:
1. `create_area_constraints` function creates constraints for each breadth area.
2. `areas` dictionary defines courses for each area.
3. Constraints ensure that:
    - Three different courses are chosen from different breadth areas.
    - Each course is taken for at least 3 units and completed for a letter grade.
    - Courses are unique.
    - Advisor approvals are considered.
4. Using the solver, combined constraints are asserted, and satisfiability is checked.

I've ensured that the script is parameterized and does not use rigid loops and conditionals where not necessary. The transcript example within the script demonstrates how the SAT check would be used.
