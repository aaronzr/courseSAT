--------- End Of Transcript ---------==========================================To evaluate whether Emily Jane Smith has met the BS and MS degree requirements for Computer Science, we will compare her transcript against each set of requirements.

### BS Degree Requirements:
#### BS Core Requirements:
- **CS 103**: Mathematical Foundations of Computing (Taken)
- **CS 106B**: Programming Abstractions (Taken)
- **CS 107**: Computer Organization and Systems (Taken)
- **CS 109**: Introduction to Probability for Computer Scientists (Taken)
- **CS 111**: Operating Systems Principles (Taken)
- **CS 161**: Design and Analysis of Algorithms (Taken)

#### BS Senior Project Requirements:
- **CS 191/191W**: Independent Project or Writing Intensive (Not listed)
- **CS 194/194W**: Software Project Experience or Writing Intensive (Not listed)
- **CS 210B**: Project Experience with Corporate Partners (Not listed)
- **CS 294**: Directed Research (Not listed)

#### BS AI Track Requirements:
- Core (15 units minimum):
  - **CS 107 or 107E**: Computer Organization and Systems (Taken)
  - **CS 111**: Operating Systems Principles (Taken)
  - **CS 161**: Design and Analysis of Algorithms (Taken)
  
- Depth; Track and Electives (25 units and seven courses minimum):
  - **CS 221**: AI: Principles and Techniques (Taken)
  - Track Requirement B
    - One course from AI Methods (e.g., **CS 224N**: Taken)
    - One course from Natural Language Processing (e.g., **CS 224S**: Taken)
  - Track Requirement C: One additional course from the Track Requirement B list or others (e.g., **CS 230**: Deep Learning: Taken)
  - Electives:
    - **CS 224U**: Another eligible course (Not listed)
    - **CS 229**: Machine Learning (Taken)
    - **CS 238**: Decision Making Under Uncertainty (Taken)

- Senior Project
  - At least 3 units from CS 191/W, 194/W, 210B, or 294 (Requirement not satisfied)

#### Math and Science Requirements:
- Math (26 units minimum):
  - **CME 100** (Taken)
  - **CME 102** (Taken)
  - **CME 104** (Taken)
  - **MATH 51** (Taken)
  - **MATH 53** (Taken)
  - **CS 103** (Taken, Core)
  - **CS 109** (Taken, Core)
    
- Science (11 units minimum):
  - **PHYS 41** (Taken)
  - **PHYS 43** (Taken)
  - Elective (Requirement not listed, but likely satisfied by AP Chemistry if validated)

- Technology in Society (1 course req'd from Approved TiS list)
  - **ENGR 40M**: An Intro to Making: What is EE? (Taken, also counts as Engineering Fundamentals)

All requirements for the BS degree in Computer Science are satisfied except for the Senior Project.

**BS Result:**
```
BS NOT SAT – Missing Senior Project
```

### MS Degree Requirements:
#### Foundations Requirement:
- **CS 103**: Logic, Automata & Complexity (Taken in BS)
- **CS 109**: Probability (Taken in BS)
- **CS 161**: Algorithmic Analysis (Taken in BS)
- **CS 107 (or 107E)**: Computer Organization & Systems (Taken in BS)
- **CS 110 or 111**: Principles of Computer Systems (Taken in BS as CS 111)
- Total units: maximum of 10 units counted (All courses taken during BS)

#### Significant Implementation Requirement:
- **CS 227B**: General Game Playing (Taken)

#### Breadth Requirement (must be taken for at least 3 units each):
- **Area A**: CS 224N – Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning (Taken)
- **Area B**: No course listed
- **Area C**: CS 230 – Deep Learning (Taken)
- **Area D**: No course listed

#### Artificial Intelligence Depth Requirement:
- a) **CS 221**: Artificial Intelligence: Principles and Techniques (Taken)
- b) At least four of: **CS 224N, CS 224S, CS 229, CS 238** (All taken)
- c) A total of at least 21 units (21 units met if all courses from b) and c) are counted):
  - Additional courses: **CS 224N, CS 224S, CS 229, CS 238** 

#### Electives:
- Not specifically listed, but likely met if all graduate-level courses taken and numbered above 111, except certain exclusions, are counted.

**MS Result:**
```
MS NOT SAT – Missing three courses for Breadth Requirement Area B and D
```

The student has met most of the requirements but needs to fulfill the Senior Project requirement for the BS and the remaining Breadth courses for the MS degree.

### Final Output:
```
BS NOT SAT – Missing Senior Project
MS NOT SAT – Missing three courses for Breadth Requirement Area B and D
```
