==========================================Based on the provided student's transcript and the degree requirements, we'll first analyze whether the student's BS requirements are satisfied.

### BS Requirements Analysis:

#### Core Requirements:
- **CS106B**: Completed Winter 2020-2021
- **CS107**: Completed Autumn 2021-2022
- **CS111**: Completed Winter 2021-2022
- **CS103**: Completed Autumn 2021-2022
- **CS109**: Completed Spring 2020-2021
- **CS161**: Completed Winter 2021-2022

#### Senior Project:
- **CS191**: Completed Spring 2022-2023 (Independent Project)

#### Math Requirements:
- **MATH 19/20/21 or equivalent**: Completed via AP Calculus AB (10 units)
- **MATH 51**: Completed Autumn 2020-2021
- **MATH 52**: Completed Winter 2020-2021
- **MATH 53**: Completed Spring 2020-2021

Two electives (26 units minimum in total):
- **CS103** was already counted towards core.
- Thus, we use **MATH 51, 52, 53, and the AP Calculus AB credit for 20 units.**

#### Science Requirements:
- **PHYSICS 41**: Completed Autumn 2020-2021
- **PHYSICS 43**: Completed Winter 2020-2021
- **Elective**: PHYSICS 45 Completed Autumn 2021-2022
- (Science Unit Total: 11 units minimum)

#### Engineering Fundamentals:
- **CS106B**: Counted.
- **ENGR 40M**: Completed Autumn 2021-2022

#### Technology in Society:
- **HISTORY 150C**: Completed Winter 2021-2022 (fulfills Technology in Society requirement)

#### Depth and AI Track Requirements:
- **CS221**: Completed Spring 2021-2022
- **CS224N**: Completed Spring 2021-2022
- **CS123**: Completed Autumn 2022-2023
- **CS234**: Completed Autumn 2022-2023
- **CS225A**: Completed Spring 2022-2023
- **CS228**: Completed Spring 2022-2023
- **CS237A**: Completed Spring 2022-2023

Three additional electives:
- **CS230**: Completed Autumn 2023-2024
- **CS231N**: Completed Autumn 2023-2024
- **CS191**: Completed as the senior project, counted towards depth elective as a possibility via the elective flexibility.
  
Summarizing, all BS requirements appear to be satisfied. Therefore:
### BS SAT

### Moving on to MS Requirements Analysis:

#### Foundations Requirement:
- **CS103**: Covered by BS (grade: B)
- **Probability (CS109)**: Covered by BS (grade: B+)
- **Algorithmic Analysis (CS161)**: Covered by BS (grade: B+)
- **Computer Organization & Sys (CS107)**: Covered by BS (grade: B+)
- **Principles of Computer Systems (CS111)**: Covered by BS (grade: B+)

#### Significant Implementation Requirement:
Courses that may potentially satisfy this requirement:
- **CS 194**: Taken (Software Project Experience with a grade of A, and may satisfy this requirement)

#### Breadth Requirement (from different areas):
- **Area A. Mathematical and Theoretical Foundations**: None listed in transcript for MS
- **Area B. Computer Systems**: Covered by multiple CS 107 or 111
- **Area C. Applications**: CS 224N, CS 225A, CS 228, or CS 237A
- **Area D. Computing and Society**: None listed in transcript for MS

Additional Breadth Requirement:
CS 195S and various other advanced courses may satisfy additional breadth areas if classified correctly.

#### Artificial Intelligence Depth:
- **CS221**: Completed
- **Four of the listed courses** (CS 223A, 224N, 224S, 224U, etc.)

Courses:
1. **CS 224N**: Completed
2. **CS 224S**: Completed
3. **CS 228**: Completed
4. **CS 237A**: Completed

Additional courses:
- **CS230**: Completed
- **CS231N**: Completed
- **CS328**: Completed
- **CS399**: Completed

Total Depth Units from Depth and additional (must be >=21 units):
Summation of these units easily exceeds 21.

#### Electives:
- **Multiple courses listed qualify as electives**

Given that all requirements appear to have been met based on the courses taken, grades, and units:
### MS SAT
