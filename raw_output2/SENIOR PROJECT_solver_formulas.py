To generate the CVC5 formulas in Python for the Senior Project requirement specified in the document, we need to verify that the student has taken at least one of the listed Senior Project courses, and that the total units from these courses add up to at least 3 units. Here's how you can do that using the CVC5 solver in Python.

First, you need to install the CVC5 Python package if you haven't already. You can install it using pip:

```sh
pip install cvc5
```

Next, assuming `course_choices` is given in the following format:

```python
course_choices = {
    'cs191': [True, 3],
    'cs191w': [False, 0],
    'cs194': [False, 0],
    'cs194h': [False, 0],
    'cs194w': [False, 0],
    'cs210b': [False, 0],
    'cs294': [False, 0]
}
```

Below is the Python code that creates and checks the CVC5 formulas for validating the Senior Project requirement:

```python
import cvc5

# Initialize solver
solver = cvc5.Solver()

# Set logic, you can choose the logic as per your requirement; here we're using QF_BV (Quantifier-Free Bit-Vector)
solver.setLogic("QF_LIA")

# Define the courses
courses = ['cs191', 'cs191w', 'cs194', 'cs194h', 'cs194w', 'cs210b', 'cs294']

# Create boolean variables and unit variables for each course
course_vars = {course: [solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), course), solver.mkConst(solver.getIntegerSort(), f"{course}_units")] for course in courses}

# Constraints to check if at least one course is taken and units for taken courses should be >= 3
taken_courses = [course_vars[course][0] for course in courses]
taken_units = [solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.ITE, course_vars[course][0], course_vars[course][1], solver.mkInteger(0)) for course in courses]

# Assert formulas
# At least one course must be taken
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.OR, *taken_courses))

# Sum of units of taken courses must be at least 3
total_units = solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.ADD, *taken_units)
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.GEQ, total_units, solver.mkInteger(3)))

# Now, add the specific units for each course from course_choices
for course, (is_taken, units) in course_choices.items():
    if course in course_vars:
        solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.EQUAL, course_vars[course][0], solver.mkBoolean(is_taken)))
        solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.EQUAL, course_vars[course][1], solver.mkInteger(units)))

# Check if the constraints are satisfied
if solver.checkSat().isSat():
    print("The course choices satisfy the Senior Project requirements.")
else:
    print("The course choices do not satisfy the Senior Project requirements.")
```

Explanation:

1. **Initialize Solver**: We start by initializing the CVC5 solver.
2. **Define Courses**: We define the list of courses relevant to the Senior Project.
3. **Create Variables**: For each course, we create a boolean variable to indicate if the course is taken and an integer variable to represent the units.
4. **Formulas**:
    - We create a formula to check that at least one of the courses is taken.
    - We create a formula to ensure the total units from the Senior Project courses are at least 3.
5. **Assert Formulas**: We use `solver.assertFormula` to add these constraints to the solver.
6. **Add Course Choices**: We iterate through `course_choices` and set the values accordingly in the solver.
7. **Check Satisfaction**: Finally, we check if the constraints are satisfied using `solver.checkSat()`.

This code verifies if the given `course_choices` meet the Senior Project requirements based on the specified criteria.
