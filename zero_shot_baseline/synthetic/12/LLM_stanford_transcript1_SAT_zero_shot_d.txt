**Conclusion:**
- "BS SAT"========================GPT Answer to Prompt Two Regarding MS Requirements====================
Based on the analysis of Alex Michael Johnson's transcript and the provided MS in Computer Science requirements, we can evaluate whether all MS requirements are met.

### MSCS Requirements Assessment

1. **Foundations Requirement:**
   - CS 103: Mathematical Foundations of Computing (taken, grade B+)
   - CS 109: Introduction to Probability for Computer Scientists (taken, B+)
   - CS 161: Design and Analysis of Algorithms (taken, A-)
   - CS 107: Computer Organization and Systems (taken, B+)
   - CS 111: Operating Systems Principles (taken, A)
   - **Total Units Used to Satisfy Foundations Requirement: 10 units**

2. **Significant Implementation Requirement:**
   - **Example courses taken that satisfy this requirement:**
     - CS 210A: Advanced Software Development (taken, A)
     - CS 140: Operating Systems (taken, A-)
     - CS 210B: Project Experience with Corporate Partners (taken, A)
   - **Assumed CS 210A as the primary for this requirement to meet the letter grade condition.**

3. **Breadth Requirement:**
   - **Area A. Mathematical and Theoretical Foundations:**
     - CS 240: Algorithm Design Techniques (taken, B+)
     
   - **Area B. Computer Systems:**
     - CS 210A: Advanced Software Development (taken, A)
     
   - **Area C. Applications:**
     - CS 245: Database Management Systems (taken, B+)
     
   - **Area D. Computing and Society:**
     - No courses taken listed explicitly under Area D. Requires attention.

4. **Artificial Intelligence Depth:**
   - **Core Course:**
     - CS 221: AI: Principles and Techniques (taken, B+)
   
   - **At least four of:**
     - CS 223A: Robotics (taken, B+)
     - CS 224N: Natural Language Processing (taken, A-)
     - CS 237A: Introduction to Robotics (taken, B+)
     - CS 228: Statistical Learning Theory (taken, A-)

   - **Total Units from Depth categories a, b, c:**
     - CS 221: 5 units
     - CS 228: 3 units
     - CS 224N: 3 units
     - CS 223A: 3 units
     - CS 237A: 3 units
     - CS 234: 3 units (taken, B+)
     - CS 238: 3 units (taken, A)
     - Total: 23 units (exceeds 21 units requirement)

5. **Electives:**
   - **Example courses meeting the elective requirements:**
     - CS 356: Cryptography (3 units)
     - CS 348: Graphics Programming (3 units)
     - Other additional courses to fulfill 45-unit total excluding foundation units.
   - **Elective units totaled and additional constraints appear satisfied based on common practices.**

### Based on the above analysis:
The main missing element appears to be the **Breadth requirement for Area D: Computing and Society**. The student's transcript does not show any courses from Area D explicitly to satisfy this requirement.

**Output**:
```
Area D Computing and Society requirement not satisfied
```
