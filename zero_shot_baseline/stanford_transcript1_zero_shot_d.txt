- Not listed in transcript

### BREADTH REQUIREMENT: (3 courses from different areas A, B, C, D)

1. **Area A (Mathematical and Theoretical Foundations)** - Not listed in transcript
2. **Area B (Computer Systems)** - Not listed in transcript
3. **Area C (Applications)** - Not listed in transcript
4. **Area D (Computing and Society)** - **MS&E 193 (A-)**

### ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE DEPTH:

- Courses must meet 21 units total from specified lists
  - **a) CS 221**: Not listed
  - **b) Four courses from*: CS 223A, 224N, 224S, 224U, 224V, 224W, 228, 229, 231A, 231N, 234, 237A, 237B, 238** - Not listed
