1. Identify the parameters and create boolean variables for them.
2. Translate each statement into a corresponding SMT formula.
3. Create the test case to evaluate the test statement.

Let's begin. First, we'll create the boolean variables for each relevant entity and their properties/relations.

```python
import cvc5
from cvc5 import Kind

solver = cvc5.Solver()

# Create boolean variables for relevant entities and properties
Tiger = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), 'Tiger')
Bear = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), 'Bear')
BaldEagle = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), 'BaldEagle')
Dog = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), 'Dog')

# Properties
Tiger_Nice = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), 'Tiger_Nice')
Tiger_Rough = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), 'Tiger_Rough')
Bear_Nice = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), 'Bear_Nice')
BaldEagle_Nice = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), 'BaldEagle_Nice')
Dog_Nice = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), 'Dog_Nice')
Dog_Blue = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), 'Dog_Blue')
Dog_Big = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), 'Dog_Big')
Dog_Rough = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), 'Dog_Rough')

# Relations
Tiger_Visits_Bear = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), 'Tiger_Visits_Bear')
Bear_Likes_BaldEagle = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), 'Bear_Likes_BaldEagle')
Someone_Blue_Rough_Eats_Tiger = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), 'Someone_Blue_Rough_Eats_Tiger')  # Placeholder
Someone_Nice_LikesBear_Visits_Bear = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), 'Someone_Nice_LikesBear_Visits_Bear')  # Placeholder
Someone_LikesBaldEagle_Likes_Bear = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), 'Someone_LikesBaldEagle_Likes_Bear')  # Placeholder
Dog_Likes_Tiger = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), 'Dog_Likes_Tiger')
BaldEagle_Likes_Dog = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), 'BaldEagle_Likes_Dog')
Bear_Eats_BaldEagle = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), 'Bear_Eats_BaldEagle')
Bear_Likes_Dog = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), 'Bear_Likes_Dog')
Bear_Visits_Tiger = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), 'Bear_Visits_Tiger')
Dog_Visits_BaldEagle = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), 'Dog_Visits_BaldEagle')
Tiger_Likes_BaldEagle = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), 'Tiger_Likes_BaldEagle')
```

Now, let's translate each contextual statement into its corresponding SMT formula:

### Contextual Statements
1. **If the tiger visits the bear then the bear likes the bald eagle.**
```python
stmt1 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, Tiger_Visits_Bear, Bear_Likes_BaldEagle)
solver.assertFormula(stmt1)
```

2. **If someone is blue and rough then they eat the tiger.**
```python
# We make this more general with placeholders
stmt2 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, Someone_Blue_Rough_Eats_Tiger, Tiger_Rough), Tiger)
solver.assertFormula(stmt2)
```

3. **If someone is nice and they like the bear then they visit the bear.**
```python
stmt3 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, Someone_Nice_LikesBear_Visits_Bear, Bear_Nice), Bear_Visits_Tiger)
solver.assertFormula(stmt3)
```

4. **If someone likes the bald eagle then they like the bear.**
```python
stmt4 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, Someone_LikesBaldEagle_Likes_Bear, Bear_Likes_Dog)
solver.assertFormula(stmt4)
```

5. **If the dog is big and the dog is not rough then the dog likes the tiger.**
```python
stmt5 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, Dog_Big, solver.mkTerm(Kind.NOT, Dog_Rough)), Dog_Likes_Tiger)
solver.assertFormula(stmt5)
```

6. **The bald eagle is nice.**
```python
stmt6 = BaldEagle_Nice
solver.assertFormula(stmt6)
```

7. **The bald eagle likes the dog.**
```python
stmt7 = BaldEagle_Likes_Dog
solver.assertFormula(stmt7)
```

8. **The bear eats the bald eagle.**
```python
stmt8 = Bear_Eats_BaldEagle
solver.assertFormula(stmt8)
```

9. **The bear is nice.**
```python
stmt9 = Bear_Nice
solver.assertFormula(stmt9)
```

10. **The bear likes the dog.**
```python
stmt10 = Bear_Likes_Dog
solver.assertFormula(stmt10)
```

11. **The bear visits the tiger.**
```python
stmt11 = Bear_Visits_Tiger
solver.assertFormula(stmt11)
```

12. **The dog is blue.**
```python
stmt12 = Dog_Blue
solver.assertFormula(stmt12)
```

13. **The dog is nice.**
```python
stmt13 = Dog_Nice
solver.assertFormula(stmt13)
```

14. **The dog visits the bald eagle.**
```python
stmt14 = Dog_Visits_BaldEagle
solver.assertFormula(stmt14)
```

15. **The tiger is nice.**
```python
stmt15 = Tiger_Nice
solver.assertFormula(stmt15)
```

16. **The tiger is rough.**
```python
stmt16 = Tiger_Rough
solver.assertFormula(stmt16)
```

17. **The tiger likes the bald eagle.**
```python
stmt17 = Tiger_Likes_BaldEagle
solver.assertFormula(stmt17)
```

### Test Statement
**The dog is not blue.**
```python
test_stmt = solver.mkTerm(Kind.NOT, Dog_Blue)
```

### Evaluate the Test Statement
```python
solver.push()
solver.assertFormula(test_stmt)
result = solver.checkSat()
print(result)  # should print whether SAT or UNSAT
solver.pop()
```

This code sets up the SMT solver with the given contextual statements and evaluates whether the test statement (the dog is not blue) is satisfied or unsatisfied. Make sure you have the CVC5 Python bindings properly installed to run this code.
