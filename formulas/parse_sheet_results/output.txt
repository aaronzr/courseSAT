=======================prompt===========================
Your task is to generate cvc5 smt solver formulas for                         Math and Science Electives requirements. You will be given a set of constraints related to 
                        Math and Science Electives and you should generate cvc5 smt solver formulas reflecting the correct logic of each given constraint.
                        The formulas will check satisfiability of a given transcript schema template as input in the following format: 
                        ```json
                        transcript = {

                        Given a transcript schema as input variables, please generate cvc5 smt solver formulas for required courses and relevant constraint. Below is an example formula for a given requiremet: Students must take one of the courses in (CS 100, CS 101, CS 102)
                        and one of the courses in (CS 101, CS 102, CS 103). The same course cannot be used to satisfy two different requirements.
                                ```
                                (set-logic ALL)

                                (declare-const course1 String)
                                (declare-const course2 String)

                                ;; Course1 is \in transcript[*].course
                                ;; Course2 is \in transcript[*].course
                        (and (= course1 course) for course in Transcript.get("Courses_Taken")
                        (= course1 course) for course in Transcript.get("Courses_Taken"))


                        ;; Course1 is in one of (100,101,102)
                        ;; Course2 is in one of (101, 102, 103)

                        ```
                        Remember, it's very important that you generate smt formulas that PARAMETRIZE
                        course variables to check variables in a given transcript against requirements. Please only generate a
                        giant prameterized formula like the following:  
                        ```smt
                        (set-logic ALL)

                        (declare-const course1 String)
                        (declare-const course2 String)
                        assert(and (and (and (and (= course1 course) for course in Transcript.get("Courses_Taken")(= course1 course) for course in Transcript.get("Courses_Taken"))(or(= course1 "CS 100")(= course1 "CS 101")(= course1 "CS 102"))(or(= course2 "CS 101")(= course2 "CS 102")(= course2 "CS 103")) (not (= course1 course2)))))
                        (check-sat)
                        ```
                        The math_elective_1_requirement checks whether a student has taken [Math51, Math52, Math53, Math54, Math104, Math107, Math108, Math109, Math110, Math113, CS 157, CS 205L, PHIL 151, CME 100, CME 102, CME 104, ENGR 108].                         Your task is to generate a parameterized smt solver formula reflecting the correct logic of this constraint: =======================formula ouput===========================
Sure, let's create a parameterized SMT formula to determine if the student has taken any of the Math Elective 1 courses from the given list. Here is the SMT formula in cvc5 syntax:

```smt
(set-logic ALL)

;; Declare the relevant variables
(declare-const math_elective_1_course String)

;; Assert the constraint to check if the student has taken at least one of the specified Math Elective 1 courses
;; Course taken must be in one of the specified Math Elective 1 courses list

(assert (exists ((i Int)) 
                (and (>= i 0)
                     (< i (seq.len transcript_courses))
                     (or (= (seq.nth transcript_courses i) "Math51")
                         (= (seq.nth transcript_courses i) "Math52")
                         (= (seq.nth transcript_courses i) "Math53")
                         (= (seq.nth transcript_courses i) "Math54")
                         (= (seq.nth transcript_courses i) "Math104")
                         (= (seq.nth transcript_courses i) "Math107")
                         (= (seq.nth transcript_courses i) "Math108")
                         (= (seq.nth transcript_courses i) "Math109")
                         (= (seq.nth transcript_courses i) "Math110")
                         (= (seq.nth transcript_courses i) "Math113")
                         (= (seq.nth transcript_courses i) "CS 157")
                         (= (seq.nth transcript_courses i) "CS 205L")
                         (= (seq.nth transcript_courses i) "PHIL 151")
                         (= (seq.nth transcript_courses i) "CME 100")
                         (= (seq.nth transcript_courses i) "CME 102")
                         (= (seq.nth transcript_courses i) "CME 104")
                         (= (seq.nth transcript_courses i) "ENGR 108")))))

;; Simulate the transcript input course titles as a sequence for testing purposes
(declare-const transcript_courses (Seq String))
(assert (= transcript_courses (seq "Math51" "CS 100" "PHIL 151"))) ;; Example transcript with three courses

;; Check satisfiability
(check-sat)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Declare Variables**: 
    - `math_elective_1_course`: A placeholder for a course that matches at least one of the Math Elective 1 courses.
2. **Transcript Processing**:
    - We assume a sequence `transcript_courses` representing courses taken from the transcript.
3. **Constraint Assertion**:
    - We use an `exists` quantifier to check if there exists an index `i` such that the course at that index in the list `transcript_courses` is one of the courses from the Math Elective 1 list.
4. **Mock Transcript**:
    - For illustration purposes, a mock transcript sequence (`transcript_courses`) is provided with courses "Math51", "CS 100", and "PHIL 151". This mock transcript helps show how the SMT solver would use the real transcript in practice.
5. **`check-sat`**:
    - This command checks if the constraints are satisfiable, i.e., if the student has taken at least one of the Math Elective 1 courses.

This formula will correctly determine whether the given transcript satisfies the Math Elective 1 requirement by asserting if at least one course from the specified list is in the transcript.
