                Your task is to identify any unfilled requirement given natural language requirement and verbalized smt formulas, which are previously verbalized by you. 
                You will be provided with verbalized fomulas and relevant natural language requirements. Given natural language requirements: FOUNDATIONS REQUIREMENT:
Logic, Automata & Complexity (CS103)
Probability (CS109, Stat116, CME106, MS&E220, or EE178)
Algorithmic Analysis (CS161)
Computer Organ & Sys (CS107 or 107E)
Principles of Computer Systems (CS110 or CS111) and 
                verbalized formulas Certainly! Here is the natural language translation of the given SMT formulas:

1. You must take exactly 5 units in each of the following five foundation categories:
   - Logic, Automata & Complexity (course_a_units = 5)
   - Probability (course_b_units = 5)
   - Algorithmic Analysis (course_c_units = 5)
   - Computer Organization & Systems (course_d_units = 5)
   - Principles of Computer Systems (course_e_units = 5)

2. The courses that can be taken in each category are as follows:
   - Logic, Automata & Complexity: CME 100, CME 102, CME 104, CS 106B, CME 106 (4 units)
   - Probability: CME 100, CME 102, CME 104, CS 106B, CME 106 (4 units)
   - Algorithmic Analysis: CME 100, CME 102, CME 104, CS 106B, CME 106 (4 units)
   - Computer Organization & Systems: CME 100, CME 102, CME 104, CS 106B, CME 106 (4 units)
   - Principles of Computer Systems: CME 100, CME 102, CME 104, CS 106B, CME 106 (4 units)

3. There is a contradiction in the current assignments, as indicated by the following assertion, which essentially invalidates the current model:
   - Taking any course will imply that you cannot satisfy all categories if the total unit count does not exceed 10.

4. The equivalence of courses required in the Logic, Automata & Complexity category with other categories are provided but appear to be technically incorrect due to an apparent contradiction.
   - Course options such as CS 103, CS109, Stat116, CME106, MS&E220, and EE178, among others, are stated equivalently, which implies that you have flexibility but suggests overlap which pieces of logic contradict.

5. The final assertion suggests an overlapping requirement that conflicts with the initial setup where only one course cannot satisfy multiple categories.

### Summary:
The SMT formula attempts to satisfy conflicting constraints where an individual course cannot fulfill multiple foundations categories in a way that satisfies all unit and course requirements. The resulting constraints are contradictory, indicating that the current model is infeasible under the provided natural language requirements., please identify specific unsatisfied courses, grades, or units.

### Analysis and Identification of Unfulfilled Requirements

To identify specific unfulfilled requirements, we need to closely compare the NATURAL LANGUAGE REQUIREMENTS and the VERBALIZED FORMULAS. Let's break these down:

#### Natural Language Requirements:
- **Logic, Automata & Complexity**: CS103 required.
- **Probability**: Options include CS109, Stat116, CME106, MS&E220, or EE178.
- **Algorithmic Analysis**: Option is CS161.
- **Computer Organization & Systems**: Options include CS107 or 107E.
- **Principles of Computer Systems**: Options include CS110 or CS111.

#### Verbalized Formulas:
1. **Unit Requirements**:
   - Each category requires exactly 5 units. 
   - Courses allocated per unit: 
     - Logic, Automata & Complexity: course_a_units = 5
     - Probability: course_b_units = 5
     - Algorithmic Analysis: course_c_units = 5
     - Computer Organization & Systems: course_d_units = 5
     - Principles of Computer Systems: course_e_units = 5

2. **Course Category Options**:
   - **Logic, Automata & Complexity**: CME 100, CME 102, CME 104, CS 106B, CME 106 (4 units)
   - **Probability**: CME 100, CME 102, CME 104, CS 106B, CME 106 (4 units)
   - **Algorithmic Analysis**: CME 100, CME 102, CME 104, CS 106B, CME 106 (4 units)
   - **Computer Organization & Systems**: CME 100, CME 102, CME 104, CS 106B, CME 106 (4 units)
   - **Principles of Computer Systems**: CME 100, CME 102, CME 104, CS 106B, CME 106 (4 units)

#### Issues and Unfulfilled Requirements:
1. **Contradictory Unit Counts**:
   - All provided courses (CME 100, CME 102, CME 104, CS 106B, CME 106) are 4-unit courses, but the requirement is for each course to be exactly 5 units.

2. **Category Courses Mismatch**:
   - **Logic, Automata & Complexity**: Should include CS103, which is missing.
   - **Probability**: Should include CS109, Stat116, CME106, MS&E220, or EE178, which does not align with the listed options.
   - **Algorithmic Analysis**: Should include CS161, missing entirely.
   - **Computer Organization & Systems**: Should include CS107 or 107E, missing entirely.
   - **Principles of Computer Systems**: Should include CS110 or CS111, missing entirely.

3. **Invalid Overlap of Categories**:
   - The same set of courses (CME options) are being attempt to be used interchangeably across distinct categories, which creates a conflict as overlapping these does not satisfy individual categories.

4. **Infeasibility of Current Model**:
   - It implies that meeting one category invalidates others due to overlapping courses and unit misalignment.

### Specific Unfulfilled Requirements:

1. **Logic, Automata & Complexity**: Missing CS103; provided courses do not match.
2. **Probability**: Missing options of CS109, Stat116, CME106, MS&E220, or EE178.
3. **Algorithmic Analysis**: Missing CS161 entirely.
4. **Computer Organization & Systems**: Missing CS107 or 107E.
5. **Principles of Computer Systems**: Missing CS110 or CS111.
6. **Units Requirement**: All provided courses are 4 units while each category requires 5 units.

### Summary:
Upon reviewing both the natural language requirements and the verbalized formulas, itâ€™s clear that the formulas do not satisfy any of the given natural language requirements and create contradictions with unit counts and course applicability. The model needs to be revised to correctly list appropriate courses per category and ensure they align with unit requirements to be capable of fulfilling all the specified foundations requirements.
