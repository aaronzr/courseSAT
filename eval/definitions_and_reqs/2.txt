                You are a seasoned SMT formulas to natural language translator. You will be provided 
                with smt core formulas, definitions of variables used in those formulas, which the
                smt solver tries to solve for, and relevant natural language requirements. Given the definitions of variables used in the formula: Below are definitions of variables in the solver formulas: 
```course```: a course in the significant implementaion area is taken 
```grade```: the taken course in  the required area meets grade requirement
```stanford```: a required course is taken at Stanford
```coterm_course_1```: an undergraduate course taken by a coterm student is used to waive the requirement
```coterm_course_2```: a second undergraduate course taken by a coterm student is used to waive the requirement and
                natural language requirements: SIGNIFICANT IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENT: At least one course in your MS program should be designated as satisfying the Significant Implementation Requirement. Note that this course will also be used to satisfy some other requirement (i.e., Depth, or Elective). Must be taken for a letter grade,* must be taken at Stanford. Coterm students who took two of these courses at Stanford as undergraduates may waive this requirement. Deviations must be approved by the faculty director of the MS program, Cynthia Lee. Course Number: Title: Grade Courses that may be used to satisfy the significant implementation requirement include: CS 140, 140E, 143, 144, 145, 148, 151, 190, 210B, 212, 221, 227B, 231N, 243, 248/248A, and 341.,

The given SMT formula can be translated into the following natural language description:

To satisfy the Significant Implementation Requirement for the MS program, you must meet one of the following sets of conditions:

1. **Main Course Condition:**
    - You must take at least one course from the list of approved significant implementation courses at Stanford.
    - The following courses qualify: CS 140, 140E, 143, 144, 145, 148, 151, 190, 210B, 212, 221, 227B, 231N, 243, 248/248A, and 341.
    - The course you choose must be taken for a letter grade. Acceptable grades include A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D-, or F.
    - The course must be taken at Stanford University.

2. **Coterm Student Waiver Condition:**
    - If you are a coterm student, you can waive the significant implementation course requirement if you took two relevant courses during your undergraduate program at Stanford.
    - These two undergraduate courses must include one of the courses from the CME series (specific sequence: CME 100 -> CME 102 -> CME 104 -> CS 106B -> CME 106),
    - Alternatively, both can be from the significant implementation courses list (CS 140 and its equivalents as per the dependency chain provided).

Please refer to the faculty director, Cynthia Lee, for any deviations from these requirements.

In summary, the formula succinctly enforces the rules that ensure a student either completes a relevant course at Stanford with an appropriate grade or uses previous undergraduate coursework to fulfill the requirement, subject to specific conditions for coterm students.
