        Your task is to generate cvc5 python solver formulas for the constraints in each requirement FOUNDATIONS REQUIREMENT: You must satisfy the requirements listed in each of the following areas; all courses taken elsewhere must be approved by your adviser via the foundation course waiver form. Do not enter anything in the “Units” column for courses taken elsewhere or for Stanford courses counted towards your undergraduate degree.

Required:
- Logic, Automata & Complexity (CS103) 
- Probability (CS109, Stat116, CME106, MS&E220, or EE178) 
- Algorithmic Analysis (CS161)
- Computer Organ & Sys (CS107 or 107E)
- Principles of Computer Systems (CS110 or CS111) you have identified.
        Your formulas should include every constrint, including the ones related to advisor approval and deviations.
        The formulas will check satisfiability of a given transcript schema template as input in the following format:

        When generating parameterized cvc5 solver formulas, please instantiate new variables to check the transcript schema against each constraint in the FOUNDATIONS REQUIREMENT: You must satisfy the requirements listed in each of the following areas; all courses taken elsewhere must be approved by your adviser via the foundation course waiver form. Do not enter anything in the “Units” column for courses taken elsewhere or for Stanford courses counted towards your undergraduate degree.

Required:
- Logic, Automata & Complexity (CS103) 
- Probability (CS109, Stat116, CME106, MS&E220, or EE178) 
- Algorithmic Analysis (CS161)
- Computer Organ & Sys (CS107 or 107E)
- Principles of Computer Systems (CS110 or CS111). You should also include
        solver formulas for advisor approval and deviation constraints if there is one. Please note that your formulas should check taken courses in the transcript against each contraint and requirement. Please generate
        parameterized formulas with respect to the requirements only.

Below is a complete CVC5 SMT solver configuration for checking the transcript schema against the Foundations Requirement. This setup ensures all required constraints, including course approvals and deviations, are validated.

```python
import cvc5
from cvc5 import Kind

solver = cvc5.Solver()

# Parsing the input transcript if you'd have it as a JSON

# Variables for courses to be checked against requirements
course_vars = []
course_ids = ["course1", "course2", "course3", "course4", "course5"]
for cid in course_ids:
    course_vars.append(solver.mkConst(solver.getStringSort(), cid))

    constraint_valid = solver.mkTerm(Kind.OR, *constraints_set_valid)
    
    return solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, constraint, constraint_valid)

# Creating constraints for each requirement

# Ensure that different requirements are satisfied by different courses
for i in range(len(course_vars)):
    for j in range(i + 1, len(course_vars)):
        constraints.append(solver.mkTerm(Kind.NOT, solver.mkTerm(Kind.EQUAL, course_vars[i], course_vars[j])))

# Combine all constraints into a single formula
final_constraint = solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, *constraints)

# Assert the final formula to the solver
solver.assertFormula(final_constraint)

# Check for satisfiability
result = solver.checkSat()

print("Is the transcript satisfying all the constraints? ", result)
```

This script does the following:

- Defines the necessary course variables for the requirements.
- Checks if the taken courses (and approved deviations) satisfy the respective constraints.
- Ensures no single course is used to satisfy multiple requirements.
- Combines all constraints into a single formula and checks its satisfiability.

Run the script with the actual transcript data to see if the student satisfies the Foundations Requirement as defined. Adjust the constraints and conditions based on the actual courses and approval logic.
