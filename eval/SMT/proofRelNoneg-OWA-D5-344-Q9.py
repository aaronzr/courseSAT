We'll use the `pycvc5` package which allows us to create and handle SMT formulas in Python.

SMT formulas will use logical connectives like `and`, `or`, `implies`, etc., and we will employ predicates for different attributes and actions. Let's start by defining the predicates for our domain:

```python
# Import the CVC5 library
import pycvc5
from pycvc5 import Solver, Kind

# Create the solver instance
solver = Solver()

# Symbol declarations. Note that in actual implementation, you would have to maintain a distinct set for each unique term (objects, attributes).
s = solver.getRoundingMode() # Short notation for connecting with each other.

Mouse = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), "Mouse")
Dog = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), "Dog")
Tiger = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), "Tiger")
BaldEagle = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), "BaldEagle")

Needs = solver.mkSymbol("Needs")
Chases = solver.mkSymbol("Chases")
Likes = solver.mkSymbol("Likes")
Is = solver.mkSymbol("Is")

# Contextual Formulas
# If someone needs the mouse and the mouse chases the dog then the dog likes the tiger.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkImplication(
    solver.mkAnd(
        solver.mkTerm(Needs, Mouse),
        solver.mkTerm(Chases, Mouse, Dog)
    ),
    solver.mkTerm(Likes, Dog, Tiger)
))

# If the dog likes the tiger and the tiger is green then the dog chases the mouse.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkImplication(
    solver.mkAnd(
        solver.mkTerm(Likes, Dog, Tiger),
        solver.mkTerm(Is, Tiger, "Green")
    ),
    solver.mkTerm(Chases, Dog, Mouse)
))

# If someone needs the dog then the dog needs the tiger.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkImplication(
    solver.mkTerm(Needs, Dog),
    solver.mkTerm(Needs, Dog, Tiger)
))

# If someone is red then they chase the dog.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkImplication(
    solver.mkTerm(Is, s, "Red"),
    solver.mkTerm(Chases, s, Dog)
))

# If someone likes the tiger then they are red.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkImplication(
    solver.mkTerm(Likes, s, Tiger),
    solver.mkTerm(Is, s, "Red")
))

# If someone is rough then they like the tiger.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkImplication(
    solver.mkTerm(Is, s, "Rough"),
    solver.mkTerm(Likes, s, Tiger)
))

# If someone chases the tiger then the tiger needs the bald eagle.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkImplication(
    solver.mkTerm(Chases, s, Tiger),
    solver.mkTerm(Needs, Tiger, BaldEagle)
))

# If someone needs the tiger and they like the bald eagle then the bald eagle needs the mouse.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkImplication(
    solver.mkAnd(
        solver.mkTerm(Needs, s, Tiger),
        solver.mkTerm(Likes, s, BaldEagle)
    ),
    solver.mkTerm(Needs, BaldEagle, Mouse)
))

# The bald eagle chases the tiger.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(Chases, BaldEagle, Tiger))

# The bald eagle is green.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(Is, BaldEagle, "Green"))

# The bald eagle likes the mouse.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(Likes, BaldEagle, Mouse))

# The bald eagle likes the tiger.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(Likes, BaldEagle, Tiger))

# The dog needs the mouse.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(Needs, Dog, Mouse))

# The mouse is rough.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(Is, Mouse, "Rough"))

# The tiger chases the bald eagle.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(Chases, Tiger, BaldEagle))

# The tiger chases the mouse.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(Chases, Tiger, Mouse))

# The tiger is round.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(Is, Tiger, "Round"))

# The tiger likes the bald eagle.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(Likes, Tiger, BaldEagle))

# The tiger needs the bald eagle.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(Needs, Tiger, BaldEagle))

# Test Statement
# The dog likes the tiger.
test_statement = solver.mkTerm(Likes, Dog, Tiger)

# Check satisfiabiliy
result = solver.checkSatAssuming(test_statement)

print(f"The test statement 'The dog likes the tiger.' is: {result}")
```

The above code sets up the context of axioms translated from English to SMT-Lib formulas using the CVC5 Python library. It then checks the satisfiability of the test statement `The dog likes the tiger`.

Please ensure you have the relevant `pycvc5` package (or equivalent) installed to run this code. Some symbolic expressions or API functions used may need adjustments depending on the specific version and implementation of the library you are using.
