Here is the translation of each natural language statement into a parameterized CVC5 SMT Python formula. Also, a test case will be generated to evaluate the test statement: "The tiger does not need the tiger."

```python
import cvc5
from cvc5 import Kind

# Initialize the solver
solver = cvc5.Solver()

# Define boolean sorts
bool_sort = solver.getBooleanSort()

# Define necessary functions
likes = solver.mkFunction("likes", [bool_sort, bool_sort], bool_sort)
is_blue = solver.mkFunction("is_blue", [bool_sort], bool_sort)
eats = solver.mkFunction("eats", [bool_sort, bool_sort], bool_sort)
is_rough = solver.mkFunction("is_rough", [bool_sort], bool_sort)
is_cold = solver.mkFunction("is_cold", [bool_sort], bool_sort)

    solver.assertFormula(constraint)

# Test statement: The tiger does not need the tiger.
test_statement = solver.mkTerm(Kind.NOT, needs(tiger, tiger))

print("Test statement is", "satisfied" if result.isSat() else "unsatisfied")
```

Note: The provided code assumes that `bool_sort` can correctly represent the defined constants (`dog`, `lion`, `mouse`, `tiger`). Depending on your specific SMT tool, you may need to modify the sorting mechanism or function definition accordingly.
