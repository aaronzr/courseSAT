To parse the natural language statements into CVC5 SMT python formulas, we will first declare the sort for the objects (rabbit, cow, etc.) and declare the required predicates. Then, we will translate each statement into a formula.

```python
import cvc5
from cvc5 import Kind

# Create a CVC5 solver instance
solver = cvc5.Solver()

# Declare sorts
Animal = solver.mkUninterpretedSort("Animal")

# Declare functions (predicates)
big = solver.mkPredicate("big", Animal)
green = solver.mkPredicate("green", Animal)
rough = solver.mkPredicate("rough", Animal)
eats = solver.mkPredicate("eats", Animal, Animal)
needs = solver.mkPredicate("needs", Animal, Animal)
sees = solver.mkPredicate("sees", Animal, Animal)
nice = solver.mkPredicate("nice", Animal)
cold = solver.mkPredicate("cold", Animal)

# Declare specific animals
rabbit = solver.mkConst(Animal, "rabbit")
cow = solver.mkConst(Animal, "cow")
bald_eagle = solver.mkConst(Animal, "bald_eagle")
mouse = solver.mkConst(Animal, "mouse")

# Convert statements into CVC5 formulas:

# All big things are green.
cond1 = solver.mkForall((Animal,), solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(big, solver.mkVar(Animal, "x")), solver.mkTerm(green, solver.mkVar(Animal, "x"))))

# If the rabbit eats the cow, then the cow needs the rabbit.
cond2 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(eats, rabbit, cow), solver.mkTerm(needs, cow, rabbit))

# Green things are rough.
cond3 = solver.mkForall((Animal,), solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(green, solver.mkVar(Animal, "x")), solver.mkTerm(rough, solver.mkVar(Animal, "x"))))

# If something sees the mouse, then it is big.
cond4 = solver.mkForall((Animal,), solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(sees, solver.mkVar(Animal, "x"), mouse), solver.mkTerm(big, solver.mkVar(Animal, "x"))))

# If something needs the rabbit, then the rabbit is nice.
cond5 = solver.mkForall((Animal,), solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(needs, solver.mkVar(Animal, "x"), rabbit), solver.mkTerm(nice, rabbit)))

# If something needs the bald eagle, then the bald eagle is nice.
cond6 = solver.mkForall((Animal,), solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(needs, solver.mkVar(Animal, "x"), bald_eagle), solver.mkTerm(nice, bald_eagle)))

# If something needs the rabbit and it is rough, then the rabbit is big.
cond7 = solver.mkForall((Animal,), solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(solver.mkAnd, solver.mkTerm(needs, solver.mkVar(Animal, "x"), rabbit), solver.mkTerm(rough, solver.mkVar(Animal, "x"))), solver.mkTerm(big, rabbit)))

# If something eats the cow, then it is green.
cond8 = solver.mkForall((Animal,), solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(eats, solver.mkVar(Animal, "x"), cow), solver.mkTerm(green, solver.mkVar(Animal, "x"))))

# Specific facts about animals
facts = [
    solver.mkTerm(big, bald_eagle),
    solver.mkTerm(cold, bald_eagle),
    solver.mkTerm(needs, bald_eagle, mouse),
    solver.mkTerm(needs, bald_eagle, rabbit),
    solver.mkTerm(sees, bald_eagle, rabbit),
    solver.mkTerm(rough, cow),
    solver.mkTerm(needs, cow, bald_eagle),
    solver.mkTerm(sees, cow, bald_eagle),
    solver.mkTerm(sees, cow, mouse),
    solver.mkTerm(eats, mouse, rabbit),
    solver.mkTerm(big, mouse),
    solver.mkTerm(needs, mouse, cow),
    solver.mkTerm(needs, mouse, rabbit),
    solver.mkTerm(eats, rabbit, bald_eagle),
    solver.mkTerm(eats, rabbit, mouse),
    solver.mkTerm(cold, rabbit)
]

# Assert conditions
solver.assertFormula(cond1)
solver.assertFormula(cond2)
solver.assertFormula(cond3)
solver.assertFormula(cond4)
solver.assertFormula(cond5)
solver.assertFormula(cond6)
solver.assertFormula(cond7)
solver.assertFormula(cond8)

# Assert facts
for fact in facts:
    solver.assertFormula(fact)

# Test statement: The rabbit is green.
test_statement = solver.mkTerm(green, rabbit)

# Check satisfiability
solver.push()
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(Kind.NOT, test_statement))
if solver.checkSat().isUnsat():
    print(f"The statement '{test_statement}' is SAT (satisfied).")
else:
    print(f"The statement '{test_statement}' is UNSAT (unsatisfied).")
solver.pop()
```

To ensure the logic and syntax are correct, you can run this code with cvc5 Python API and expect the output indicating whether 'The rabbit is green' is true based on the given context.
