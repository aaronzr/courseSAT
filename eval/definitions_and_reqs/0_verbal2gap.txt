                Your task is to identify any unfilled requirement given natural language requirement and verbalized smt formulas, which are previously verbalized by you. 
                You will be provided with verbalized fomulas and relevant natural language requirements.

Breadth courses may not be waived, must be taken for at least 3 units each, and must be completed for a letter grade.* Each of the three Breadth courses must be from different Areas.

                verbalized formulas Below is the detailed natural language translation of the SMT formulas provided:

1. **Breadth Requirement Courses:**
   - You must enroll in and complete three courses, each from a different Breadth area (A, B, C, or D).

2. **Unit Requirements:**
   - Each of the three courses must be taken for at least 3 units.
   - For specific courses such as "CME 106," the course must be taken for at least 4 units (if chosen).

3. **Grade Requirements:**
   - Each course must be completed with a letter grade.
   - Acceptable letter grades include "A+", "A", "A-", "B+", "B", "B-", "C+", "C", "C-", "D+", "D", "D-", "F".
   - For courses such as "CME 100" and "CS 106B", a minimum grade of "B" is required.
   - For courses such as "CME 102" and "CME 104", a minimum grade of "A-" is required.
   - For the course "CME 106", a minimum grade of "B+" is required.

4. **Course Selection:**
   - The courses must span different Breadth areas:
     - **Area A: Mathematical and Theoretical Foundations** 
       - Example courses: CS 154, CS 157, CS 168, CS 254, CS 261, CS 265, EE 364A, EE 364B, Phil 251
     - **Area B: Computer Systems** 
       - Example courses: CS 140, CS 140E, CS 143, CS 144, CS 149, CS 212, CS 242, CS 243, CS 244, CS 244B, CS 295, CS 316, CS 358, EE 180, EE 282, EE 382E
     - **Area C: Applications** 
       - Example courses: CS 145, CS 147, CS 148, CS 155, CS 173, CS 221, CS 223A, CS 224N, CS 224U, CS 224W, CS 227B, CS 228, CS 229, CS 229M, CS 231A, CS 231N, CS 234, CS 236, CS 237A, CS 245, CS 246, CS 247, CS 248, CS 248A, CS 251, CS 255, CS 273A, CS 273B, CS 279, CS 345, CS 347, CS 348A, CS 348B, CS 348C, CS 348E, CS 348I, CS 348K, CS 355, CS 356, CS 373
     - **Area D: Computing and Society** 
       - Note: Area D courses were not clearly preferred in these formulas.

5. **Course Combination Constraints:**
   - The three courses chosen must come from three different Breadth areas (they cannot overlap).
   - The selected combination must ensure that **course_a**, **course_b**, and **course_c** are distinct from each other.

6. **Special Course Requirements:**
   - If "course_a" is one of "CME 100", "CME 102", "CME 104", "CS 106B", or "CME 106", the specific unit and grading requirements are checked as mentioned earlier.
   - Similar checks are performed if "course_b" or "course_c" are one of these specific courses.

In summary, the formulas enforce the breadth requirement by ensuring three distinct courses are chosen from different areas, each taken for at least 3 units and completed with a satisfactory letter grade. Specific courses have stricter requirements for units and minimum grade thresholds., please identify specific unsatisfied courses, grades, or units. 
                
======================response below==============================
To identify any unfilled requirements, we will compare the detailed natural language verbalization of the SMT formulas against the provided natural language requirements. Here, we need to cross-check if each aspect of the "Breadth Requirement" is captured and enforced in the SMT verbalizations:

### Given Natural Language Requirements:
1. **Breadth Requirement**:
   - Three courses, each from a different Breadth area (A, B, C, or D).
   - Breadth courses cannot be waived.
   - Courses must be taken for at least 3 units each.
   - Courses must be completed for a letter grade.
   - Courses must be used to satisfy other requirements (Depth or Elective).

2. **Specific Courses for Areas**:
   - Area A (Mathematical and Theoretical Foundations)
   - Area B (Computer Systems)
   - Area C (Applications)
   - Area D (Computing and Society)

### Verbalized SMT Formulas Checks:
#### 1. Breadth Requirement Courses:
- **Requirement**: Three courses, each from a different Breadth area (A, B, C, or D).
- **SMT**: "You must enroll in and complete three courses, each from a different Breadth area (A, B, C, or D)."
  
#### 2. Unit Requirements:
- **Requirement**: At least 3 units for each course.
- **SMT**: "Each of the three courses must be taken for at least 3 units."
- **Note**: Specific condition of "CME 106" requiring 4 units is an additional validation, specific case only.

#### 3. Grade Requirements:
- **Requirement**: Courses completed with a letter grade.
- **SMT**: "Each course must be completed with a letter grade."
- **Additional Info in SMT**: Mention specific minimums for certain courses like "CME 100", "CS 106B" etc., which are beyond the general natural language requirement, thus not in conflict.

#### 4. Course Selection by Areas:
- **Requirement**: Courses span different Breadth areas (A, B, C, or D).
- **SMT**: Verbalization ensures courses cover different areas with specific lists provided.

#### 5. Course Combination Constraints:
- **Requirement**: Three courses from different Breadth areas cannot overlap.
- **SMT**: Verbalization explicitly ensures distinct choices among courses.

#### 6. Special Course Requirements:
- **Requirement**: Additional specific checks need to be specific courses.
- **SMT**: Account for extra checks.

### Unfilled Requirement Identification:
1. **Usage for Other Requirements**:
   - Natural Language: Courses should also satisfy Depth or Elective requirements.
   - **Missing in SMT**: There is no explicit mention that these courses should also satisfy another requirement (Depth or Elective).

2. **Waiver Condition**:
   - Natural Language: Breadth courses may not be waived.
   - **Missing in SMT**: No explicit check or mention that Breadth courses cannot be waived.

### Conclusion:
The identified unfulfilled requirements are:
- Ensuring Breadth courses can satisfy other requirements (Depth or Elective) simultaneously is not captured.
- Ensuring Breadth courses cannot be waived is not explicitly mentioned. 

These missing checks should be detailed in the verbalized SMT formulas to ensure all natural language requirements are fully met.
