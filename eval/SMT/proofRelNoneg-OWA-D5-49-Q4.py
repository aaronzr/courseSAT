Here is the translation of each given statement into CVC5 SMT python formulas followed by a test case to ensure the syntax and logic are correct.

```python
import pycvc5
from pycvc5 import Kind

# Initialize the solver
solver = pycvc5.Solver()

# Define sorts
Person = solver.getStringSort()
Animal = solver.getStringSort()
Bool = solver.getBooleanSort()

# Declare functions and predicates
is_kind = solver.mkConst(Bool, "is_kind")
visits = solver.mkConst(Bool, "visits")
eats = solver.mkConst(Bool, "eats")
needs = solver.mkConst(Bool, "needs")

# Individuals
bald_eagle = solver.mkConst(Animal, "bald_eagle")
mouse = solver.mkConst(Animal, "mouse")
squirrel = solver.mkConst(Animal, "squirrel")
tiger = solver.mkConst(Animal, "tiger")

# Define statements
# If someone is kind then they visit the tiger.
s1 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, is_kind, visits)

# If someone eats the mouse then the mouse visits the tiger.
s2 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, eats, visits)

# If the tiger eats the mouse then the tiger needs the mouse.
s3 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, eats, needs)

# If someone visits the tiger then they are round.
s4 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, visits, is_round)

# If the squirrel is round then the squirrel eats the mouse.
s5 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, is_round, eats)
s5 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, s5, squirrel)

# If the squirrel visits the tiger then the tiger is round.
s6 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, visits, is_round)
s6 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, s6, squirrel)

# If someone is round then they visit the tiger.
s7 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, is_round, visits)

# The bald eagle eats the tiger.
s8 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, eats, bald_eagle, tiger)

# The mouse visits the bald eagle.
s9 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, visits, mouse, bald_eagle)

# The squirrel is kind.
s10 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, is_kind, squirrel)

# The squirrel needs the bald eagle.
s11 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, needs, squirrel, bald_eagle)

# The squirrel needs the tiger.
s12 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, needs, squirrel, tiger)

# The tiger eats the squirrel.
s13 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, eats, tiger, squirrel)

# The tiger is red.
s14 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, tiger, "red")

# Adding all statements to the solver
solver.assertFormula(s1)
solver.assertFormula(s2)
solver.assertFormula(s3)
solver.assertFormula(s4)
solver.assertFormula(s5)
solver.assertFormula(s6)
solver.assertFormula(s7)
solver.assertFormula(s8)
solver.assertFormula(s9)
solver.assertFormula(s10)
solver.assertFormula(s11)
solver.assertFormula(s12)
solver.assertFormula(s13)
solver.assertFormula(s14)

# Test statement: The squirrel does not visit the tiger.
test_statement = solver.mkTerm(Kind.NOT, visits)
test_statement = solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, test_statement, squirrel)

# Check satisfiability
result = solver.checkSatAssuming(test_statement)
print("Test statement is", result)
```

In this translation:
- The `is_kind`, `visits`, `eats`, `needs`, and `is_round` are predicates defined as Boolean constants.
- The individuals like `bald_eagle`, `mouse`, etc., are also defined as constants.
- Complex statements are constructed using `Kind.IMPLIES` for implications and `Kind.AND` for conjunctions.

Please note that this is a simplified approach to translate the natural language to CVC5 terms. You'll need to modify the code based on your specific requirements and CVC5 APIs.

Run this script with CVC5 Python bindings to check the satisfiability of the test statement.
