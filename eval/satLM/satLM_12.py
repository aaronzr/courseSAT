To generate Z3py formulas for the given problem, we need to encode the conditions and constraints around the order of opening the valves. Here's the Python code using Z3, a high-performance theorem prover:

```python
from z3 import *

# Declare the valves
valves = ['G', 'H', 'I', 'K', 'L', 'N', 'O', 'P']

# Declare a function that maps each valve to its order in the sequence
order = Function('order', StringSort(), IntSort())

# Create constraints for the conditions specified
constraints = []

# Each valve is opened exactly once, i.e., order is between 1 and 8
for valve in valves:
    constraints.append(And(order(StringVal(valve)) >= 1, order(StringVal(valve)) <= 8))

# No two valves are opened at the same time
for i in range(len(valves)):
    for j in range(i + 1, len(valves)):
        constraints.append(order(StringVal(valves[i])) != order(StringVal(valves[j])))

# Conditions given in the problem
constraints.append(order(StringVal('K')) < order(StringVal('H')))
constraints.append(order(StringVal('P')) < order(StringVal('H')))
constraints.append(order(StringVal('H')) < order(StringVal('O')) < order(StringVal('L')))
constraints.append(order(StringVal('G')) < order(StringVal('L')))
constraints.append(order(StringVal('N')) < order(StringVal('H')))
constraints.append(order(StringVal('K')) < order(StringVal('I')))

# Create a solver and add the constraints
solver = Solver()
solver.add(constraints)

# Check each option to see if it can be the fifth valve opened
options = ['H', 'I', 'K', 'N', 'O']
results = {}
for option in options:
    # Make a copy of the solver for this particular case
    s = solver.translate(solver.ctx)
    s.add(order(StringVal(option)) == 5)
    
    if s.check() == sat:
        results[option] = "Possible"
    else:
        results[option] = "Not Possible"

print("Each of the following could be the fifth valve opened EXCEPT:")
for opt in results:
    if results[opt] == "Not Possible":
        print(f"({opt})")

```

Explanation:
1. **Declarations**:
   - We declare each valve and a function `order` that assigns an integer order to each valve.
2. **Constraints**:
   - Each valve must be opened exactly once, meaning their order must be between 1 and 8.
   - No two valves can be opened at the same time.
   - Constraints as per the problem description are added.
3. **Solver**:
   - We use a `Solver` object to manage the constraints.
   - For each option (potential fifth valve), we add a constraint setting that valve's order to 5 and check satisfiability.
4. **Results**:
   - We print out the valves that cannot be the fifth valve opened.

This Python code will help in solving which valve cannot be the fifth to be opened based on the given constraints.
