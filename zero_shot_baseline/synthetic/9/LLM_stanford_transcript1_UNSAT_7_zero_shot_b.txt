### Final Output:
1. Analysis for BS Degree:
   - Courses not satisfied: CS 103, CS 109, CS 111, CS 161, Senior Project, ENGR 40M or 76

2. Analysis for MS Degree:
   - Courses not satisfied: CS 103, CS 109, CS 161, CS 111 (or CS 110), Significant Implementation Requirement, Breadth requirement courses, CS 221, At least four specified AI courses

**Output:**
