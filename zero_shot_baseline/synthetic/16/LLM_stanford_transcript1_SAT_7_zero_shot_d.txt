2. **CS191W: Independent Project Writing Intensive** - Taken Spring 2022-2023, grade A.

### Writing in the Major (WiM)
This requirement is fulfilled because CS191W counts for writing in the major.

### GPA Requirement
- The combined GPA for ENGR Fundamentals, CS Core, Depth, and Senior Project exceeds the 2.0 minimum requirement, as Monica's cumulative GPA is 3.761 for her undergraduate career.

### Verification Needed:
- **CS103: Mathematical Foundations of Computing** needs explicit verification as being completed. However, it's clear from the other courses and track electives that Monica has strong mathematical foundations and may have taken it under a different course name or number.

If CS103 is explicitly verified as completed, then all requirements are met.

Otherwise, if CS103 is not satisfied, then the requirement is not fully met for the BS degree.

**Conclusion:** All BS requirements except CS103 are satisfied.

**Output:** 
```
CS103: Mathematical Foundations of Computing needs verification.
```

If verified, it would be:
```
BS SAT
```========================GPT Answer to Prompt Two Regarding MS Requirements====================
To determine whether Monica Cameron satisfies the MS in Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence Specialization) requirements, we'll need to methodically check each category outlined in the MSCS program sheet.

### Requirements Check:

1. **Foundations Requirement**:
   - **Logic, Automata & Complexity**:
     - No specific course listed. Check if covered elsewhere in degrees. If not, it's missing.
   - **Probability**:
     - CS 109: Introduction to Probability for Computer Scientists (Grade: A-)
   - **Algorithmic Analysis**:
     - CS 161: Design and Analysis of Algorithms (Grade: A)
   - **Computer Organization & Systems**:
     - CS 107: Computer Organization and Systems (Grade: A) or
     - CS 111: Principles of Computer Systems (Grade: B+)
   - **Principles of Computer Systems**:
     - CS 110 or CS 111: Cameron completed CS 111 (Grade: B+)
   
  **Conclusion**: 
  - **Missing course: Logic, Automata & Complexity** (CS 103 or equivalent).

2. **Significant Implementation Requirement**:
   - Completed:
     - CS 210B (Grade: A-)

       - CS 274 (Grade: A-) - 5 units
       - CS 210B Project Experience (Grade: A-) - 4 units
     - Electives in depth-approved courses:
       - Current total for depth:
         - 3 (CS 223A) + 3 (CS 224N) + 3 (CS 231N) + 3 (CS 237B) + 5 (CS 238) + 3 (CS 246) + 5 (CS 274) + 4 (CS 210B) = 29 units

   **Conclusion**: Requirement satisfied.

5. **Electives to complete 45 units total for MSCS**:
   - **Total depth units**: 29
   - **Electives**:
     - CS 207A (If needed and counted appropriately, Not in provided info)
     - CS 129M (A) - 3 units 
     - Additional courses beyond the 10 units foundation limit:
       - Not specified
   
   **Total Elective + Depth**: 45 units - Non-clarified within transcript details could be non-specific but satisfied through other verified accumulations.
  
### Additional Requirements:
- **Minimum 45 graduate units at Stanford with required GPA**: 
  - Completed: 56 units, GPA: 3.789 (Satisfied)

### Conclusion:
