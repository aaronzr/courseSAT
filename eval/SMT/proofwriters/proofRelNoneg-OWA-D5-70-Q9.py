First, we need to import the cvc5 package and initialize the solver:

```python
import cvc5
from cvc5 import Kind

solver = cvc5.Solver()

# Define the Boolean sort
Bool = solver.getBooleanSort()

# Define the predicates
sees = solver.mkPredicate(["sees"], [Bool, Bool])
visits = solver.mkPredicate(["visits"], [Bool, Bool])
chases = solver.mkPredicate(["chases"], [Bool, Bool])
is_red = solver.mkPredicate(["is_red"], [Bool])
is_kind = solver.mkPredicate(["is_kind"], [Bool])
is_big = solver.mkPredicate(["is_big"], [Bool])
is_young = solver.mkPredicate(["is_young"], [Bool])
```

Now, we'll define the parametersâ€”the individual animals involved:

```python
lion = solver.mkConst(Bool, "lion")
bear = solver.mkConst(Bool, "bear")
squirrel = solver.mkConst(Bool, "squirrel")
mouse = solver.mkConst(Bool, "mouse")
```

Now, let's convert each statement into a CVC5 SMT formula step by step:

1. If someone sees the lion and the lion is kind then they are red.

```python
u = solver.mkVar(Bool, "u")  # generic someone
statement1 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES,
               solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, 
                   [sees(u, lion), is_kind(lion)]), 
               is_red(u))
solver.assertFormula(statement1)
```

2. If someone visits the lion and they are red then the lion visits the squirrel.

```python
statement2 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, 
               solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, 
                   [visits(u, lion), is_red(u)]), 
               visits(lion, squirrel))
solver.assertFormula(statement2)
```

3. If someone is kind then they see the lion.

```python
statement3 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, 
               is_kind(u), 
               sees(u, lion))
solver.assertFormula(statement3)
```

4. If the lion visits the squirrel then the lion chases the bear.

```python
statement4 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, 
               visits(lion, squirrel), 
               chases(lion, bear))
solver.assertFormula(statement4)
```

5. If the squirrel chases the lion then the lion is kind.

```python
statement5 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, 
               chases(squirrel, lion), 
               is_kind(lion))
solver.assertFormula(statement5)
```

6. If someone is big then they chase the lion.

```python
statement6 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, 
               is_big(u), 
               chases(u, lion))
solver.assertFormula(statement6)
```

7. If someone chases the bear then the bear is big.

```python
statement7 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, 
               chases(u, bear), 
               is_big(bear))
solver.assertFormula(statement7)
```

8. If someone chases the lion then the lion is kind.

```python
statement8 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, 
               chases(u, lion), 
               is_kind(lion))
solver.assertFormula(statement8)
```

9. If someone is red then they visit the bear.

```python
statement9 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, 
               is_red(u), 
               visits(u, bear))
solver.assertFormula(statement9)
```

Now for the given facts:

10. The bear sees the lion.

```python
fact10 = sees(bear, lion)
solver.assertFormula(fact10)
```

11. The bear visits the lion.

```python
fact11 = visits(bear, lion)
solver.assertFormula(fact11)
```

12. The bear visits the squirrel.

```python
fact12 = visits(bear, squirrel)
solver.assertFormula(fact12)
```

13. The lion chases the bear.

```python
fact13 = chases(lion, bear)
solver.assertFormula(fact13)
```

14. The lion chases the mouse.

```python
fact14 = chases(lion, mouse)
solver.assertFormula(fact14)
```

15. The lion is big.

```python
fact15 = is_big(lion)
solver.assertFormula(fact15)
```

16. The lion sees the squirrel.

```python
fact16 = sees(lion, squirrel)
solver.assertFormula(fact16)
```

17. The mouse chases the bear.

```python
fact17 = chases(mouse, bear)
solver.assertFormula(fact17)
```

18. The mouse visits the lion.

```python
fact18 = visits(mouse, lion)
solver.assertFormula(fact18)
```

19. The squirrel is young.

```python
fact19 = is_young(squirrel)
solver.assertFormula(fact19)
```

20. The squirrel visits the lion.

```python
fact20 = visits(squirrel, lion)
solver.assertFormula(fact20)
```

21. The squirrel visits the mouse.

```python
fact21 = visits(squirrel, mouse)
solver.assertFormula(fact21)
```

Finally, the test statement: The lion is red.

```python
test_statement = is_red(lion)
```

We add the test statement to the solver and check for the model:

```python
solver.assertFormula(test_statement)
result = solver.checkSat()
print(result)
```

This code translates the given natural language statements into parameterized CVC5 SMT formulas and evaluates whether the statement "The lion is red" is satisfied.
