==========================================### BS Degree Requirements Analysis

#### Core Requirements:
1. **CS 103 (Mathematical Foundations of Computing)**: Not completed.
2. **CS 106B (Programming Abstractions)**: Not completed.
3. **CS 107 (Computer Organization and Systems)**: Completed with B+.
4. **CS 109 (Introduction to Probability)**: Completed with A-.
5. **CS 111 (Principles of Computer Systems)**: Not completed.
6. **CS 161 (Design and Analysis of Algorithms)**: Not completed.
7. **GPA Requirement**: Current GPA in the Computer Science-related courses is 3.179 (based on CS 101, CS 101C, CS 107, CS 109) which satisfies the 2.0 minimum GPA requirement.

#### Senior Project:
1. **Requirement**: Not completed.

#### Mathematics Requirements:
1. **MATH 19, 20, 21 (Calculus Series)**: Completed via AP credit for 8 units.
2. **MATH 51 (Linear Algebra)**: Completed with B+.
3. **MATH 52 (Multivariable Calculus)**: Completed with A-.
4. **MATH 53 (Ordinary Differential Equations)**: Completed with C+.
5. **PHIL 151 (Logic)**: Completed with C-.
   - Another math elective might be needed due to poor performance.
6. **MATH 104 (Complex Analysis)**: Completed with C.
7. **STATS 116 (Statistical Inference)**: Completed with B+.

#### Science Requirements:
1. **PHYS 41 (Mechanics)**: Completed (PHYS 21 equivalent with B).
2. **PHYS 43 (E/M)**: Completed (PHYS 22 with C+).
3. **Elective**: Completed (BIO 103 with C).

#### Engineering Fundamentals:
1. **CS 106B**: Not completed.
2. **ENGR 40M or 76**: Not completed.
3. **Total Required Units**: Not satisfied.

#### Technology in Society Requirement:
1. **Course**: Must be from the approved list (not identified in transcript).

### Summary of BS Completion:
Based on the data, the student has not met all the BS requirements. They are missing courses in the core requirements, senior project, specific electives, and engineering fundamentals. Therefore:

**Output**: 

1. CS 103
2. CS 106B
3. CS 111
4. CS 161
5. Senior Project (CS 191/191W/194/194W/210B/294)
6. Technology in Society course
7. Engineering Fundamentals (CS 106B, ENGR 40M or 76)


### MS Degree Requirements Analysis

#### Foundation Requirements:
1. **Logic, Automata & Complexity (CS103)**: Not completed during undergraduate.
2. **Probability (CS109)**: Completed with A-.
3. **Algorithmic Analysis (CS161)**: Not completed.
4. **Computer Org & Sys (CS107)**: Completed with B+.
5. **Principles of Computer Systems (CS110 or CS111)**: Not completed.

#### Significant Implementation Requirement:
- Must take one of the required courses. Not available in the transcript.

#### Breadth Requirements:
- Not determined as no information provided on Breadth areas taken.

#### Depth Requirements (AI Specialization):
- **CS 221**: Not completed.
- Four courses from: CS 223A, 224N, 224S, 224U, 224V, 224W, 228, 229, 231A, 231N, 234, 237A, 237B, 238: Not specified in transcript.
- Total of 21 units from depth categories: Unable to determine total units from depth categories.

#### Electives:
- No elective courses identified.

### Summary of MS Completion:
The transcript does not provide sufficient evidence to determine whether all MS requirements are met. The student lacks foundational courses, significant implementation courses, depth requirements, and electives.

**Output**:
1. CS 103
2. CS 161
3. CS 110/CS 111
4. Significant Implementation course.
5. Breadth courses from different areas.
6. Depth courses for AI specialization.
7. Electives to meet total unit requirement of 45 units.
