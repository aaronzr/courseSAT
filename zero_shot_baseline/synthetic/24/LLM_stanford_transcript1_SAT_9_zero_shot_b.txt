Let's analyze Samantha Mae Fisher's transcript to check if it meets the BS and MS requirements respectively:

### BS Core Requirements:
#### Core Courses:
1. **CS106B:** Programming Abstractions - Completed in Autumn 2020-2021, Grade: B+
2. **CS107:** Computer Organization and Systems - Completed in Winter 2020-2021, Grade: A-
3. **CS111:** Principles of Computer Systems - Completed in Spring 2020-2021, Grade: B+
4. **CS103:** Mathematical Foundations of Computing - Completed in Autumn 2020-2021, Grade: B
5. **CS109:** Intro to Probability for Computer Scientists - Completed in Spring 2020-2021, Grade: A
6. **CS161:** Design and Analysis of Algorithms - Completed in Autumn 2021-2022, Grade: B+

#### Additional Requirements:
- **Senior Project:** CS194 Software Project Experience - Completed in Spring 2022-2023, Grade: A-
- **Minimum 2.0 GPA:** Total GPA for ENGR Fundamentals, CS Core, Depth, and Senior Project is met with a 3.710 cumulative GPA.

### BS Senior Project Requirement:
- Samantha completed **CS194 Software Project Experience**, which is listed as one of the options for the Senior Project requirement.

### AI Elective Requirements:
#### Core:
1. **CS107/107E:** Computer Organization and Systems - Completed
2. **CS111:** Operating Systems Principles - Completed
3. **CS161:** Design and Analysis of Algorithms - Completed

#### AI Depth and Track:
1. **CS221:** AI: Principles and Techniques - Completed
2. **Track B** (From different areas)
   - **CS124:** From Language to Information - Completed
   - **CS229:** Machine Learning - Completed
3. **Track C:**
   - **CS224N:** Completed
4. **Electives:**
   - **CS224U:** Completed
   - **CS231A:** Completed
   - **CS238:** Completed

Based on all the data points, all BS requirements appear to be satisfied.

**BS SAT**

### MS Specialization Requirements:
#### Foundations Requirement:
1. **Logic, Automata & Complexity (CS103):** Completed in UG
2. **Probability (CS109):** Completed in UG
3. **Algorithmic Analysis (CS161):** Completed in UG
4. **Computer Org & Sys (CS107/107E):** Completed in UG
5. **Principles of Computer Systems (CS110/111):** Completed in UG
- **Total units for foundations requirement**: 10 units

#### Significant Implementation Requirement:
1. **CS194 Software Project Experience:** Completed in UG
- This fulfills the significant implementation requirement as well.

#### Breadth Requirement:
Three courses from different Areas:
1. **CS221 - Area C (Applications):** Completed
2. **CS107/CS111 - Area B (Computer Systems):** Completed
3. **CS103/CS109 - Area A (Mathematical and Theoretical Foundations):** Completed

#### Depth Requirement for AI:
a) **CS221:** Completed
b) Four AI Courses:
   1. **CS224N:** Completed
   2. **CS224U:** Completed
   3. **CS231A:** Completed
   4. **CS234:** Completed
c) Total of at least 21 units from above categories:
   - CS 221 (3 units)
   - CS224N (3 units)
   - CS224U (3 units)
   - CS231A (3 units)
   - CS234 (3 units)
   - Total: 15 units (additional AI elective may be needed)

#### Electives:
CS270 (Modeling Biological Systems): 3 units (note that the paper indicates 45 units total, but doesn't clearly list electives beyond the required above)

Upon reviewing, it seems Samantha may need an additional 3 units to fulfill the total required depth count for MS.

**Courses not satisfied for MS:**
    1. Additional AI Elective to satisfy 21-unit depth requirement.

Therefore:
- **BS SAT**
- **MS NOT SATISFIED: Need an additional AI elective to fulfill the 21-unit depth requirement.**
