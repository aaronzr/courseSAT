To translate the statements into CVC5 python formulas, we'll first define the necessary predicates and boolean variables. We'll then construct each sentence using these definitions.

### Step 1: Define Predicates and Boolean Variables
We'll use the following predicates and boolean variables:

- `Eats(x, y)`: `x` eats `y`.
- `Sees(x, y)`: `x` sees `y`.
- `Visits(x, y)`: `x` visits `y`.
- `IsGreen(x)`: `x` is green.
- `IsYoung(x)`: `x` is young.
- `IsRough(x)`: `x` is rough.
- `IsNice(x)`: `x` is nice.

### Step 2: Import CVC5 and Define the Solver
```python
import pycvc5
from pycvc5 import Solver
from pycvc5 import Kind

solver = Solver()
bool_sort = solver.getBooleanSort()
```

### Step 3: Define Variables
We'll use string identifiers for different entities:
```python
cat = solver.mkConst(bool_sort, "cat")
dog = solver.mkConst(bool_sort, "dog")
mouse = solver.mkConst(bool_sort, "mouse")
tiger = solver.mkConst(bool_sort, "tiger")
```

### Step 4: Define Functions for Predicates
```python
Eats = solver.mkFunction(solver.mkFuncDecl("Eats", [bool_sort, bool_sort], bool_sort))
Sees = solver.mkFunction(solver.mkFuncDecl("Sees", [bool_sort, bool_sort], bool_sort))
Visits = solver.mkFunction(solver.mkFuncDecl("Visits", [bool_sort, bool_sort], bool_sort))
IsGreen = solver.mkFunction(solver.mkFuncDecl("IsGreen", [bool_sort], bool_sort))
IsYoung = solver.mkFunction(solver.mkFuncDecl("IsYoung", [bool_sort], bool_sort))
IsRough = solver.mkFunction(solver.mkFuncDecl("IsRough", [bool_sort], bool_sort))
IsNice = solver.mkFunction(solver.mkFuncDecl("IsNice", [bool_sort], bool_sort))
```

### Step 5: Translate Statements into CVC5 Formulas

We'll now translate each statement into a CVC5 formula.

1. **If someone eats the mouse then they are green.**
```python
stmt1 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, Eats(solver.mkVar(bool_sort, 'x'), mouse), IsGreen(solver.mkVar(bool_sort, 'x')))
```

2. **If someone is young and they see the dog then they are green.**
```python
stmt2 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, IsYoung(solver.mkVar(bool_sort, 'x')), Sees(solver.mkVar(bool_sort, 'x'), dog)), IsGreen(solver.mkVar(bool_sort, 'x')))
```

3. **If someone eats the dog then they see the dog.**
```python
stmt3 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, Eats(solver.mkVar(bool_sort, 'x'), dog), Sees(solver.mkVar(bool_sort, 'x'), dog))
```

4. **If the tiger eats the dog and the dog visits the mouse then the tiger is young.**
```python
stmt4 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, Eats(tiger, dog), Visits(dog, mouse)), IsYoung(tiger))
```

5. **If someone visits the cat and the cat is nice then the cat sees the dog.**
```python
stmt5 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, Visits(solver.mkVar(bool_sort, 'x'), cat), IsNice(cat)), Sees(cat, dog))
```

6. **If someone sees the dog and the dog is green then they see the cat.**
```python
stmt6 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, Sees(solver.mkVar(bool_sort, 'x'), dog), IsGreen(dog)), Sees(solver.mkVar(bool_sort, 'x'), cat))
```

7. **If someone is rough then they eat the dog.**
```python
stmt7 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, IsRough(solver.mkVar(bool_sort, 'x')), Eats(solver.mkVar(bool_sort, 'x'), dog))
```

8. **All green people are rough**
```python
stmt8 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, IsGreen(solver.mkVar(bool_sort, 'x')), IsRough(solver.mkVar(bool_sort, 'x')))
```

9. **If someone eats the dog then the dog visits the mouse.**
```python
stmt9 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, Eats(solver.mkVar(bool_sort, 'x'), dog), Visits(dog, mouse))
```

10. **The cat is green.**
```python
stmt10 = IsGreen(cat)
```

11. **The cat sees the dog.**
```python
stmt11 = Sees(cat, dog)
```

12. **The cat visits the dog.**
```python
stmt12 = Visits(cat, dog)
```

13. **The dog eats the mouse.**
```python
stmt13 = Eats(dog, mouse)
```

14. **The dog is young.**
```python
stmt14 = IsYoung(dog)
```

15. **The dog sees the tiger.**
```python
stmt15 = Sees(dog, tiger)
```

16. **The dog visits the cat.**
```python
stmt16 = Visits(dog, cat)
```

17. **The dog visits the mouse.**
```python
stmt17 = Visits(dog, mouse)
```

18. **The mouse sees the dog.**
```python
stmt18 = Sees(mouse, dog)
```

19. **The mouse visits the cat.**
```python
stmt19 = Visits(mouse, cat)
```

20. **The mouse visits the dog.**
```python
stmt20 = Visits(mouse, dog)
```

21. **The tiger eats the cat.**
```python
stmt21 = Eats(tiger, cat)
```

22. **The tiger is nice.**
```python
stmt22 = IsNice(tiger)
```

23. **The tiger sees the dog.**
```python
stmt23 = Sees(tiger, dog)
```

24. **The tiger sees the mouse.**
```python
stmt24 = Sees(tiger, mouse)
```

25. **The tiger visits the dog.**
```python
stmt25 = Visits(tiger, dog)
```

### Step 6: The Test Statement
**The mouse does not see the cat.**
```python
test_stmt = solver.mkTerm(Kind.NOT, Sees(mouse, cat))
```

### Step 7: Assert Formulas and Check Satisfiability
```python
solver.assertFormula(stmt1)
solver.assertFormula(stmt2)
solver.assertFormula(stmt3)
solver.assertFormula(stmt4)
solver.assertFormula(stmt5)
solver.assertFormula(stmt6)
solver.assertFormula(stmt7)
solver.assertFormula(stmt8)
solver.assertFormula(stmt9)
solver.assertFormula(stmt10)
solver.assertFormula(stmt11)
solver.assertFormula(stmt12)
solver.assertFormula(stmt13)
solver.assertFormula(stmt14)
solver.assertFormula(stmt15)
solver.assertFormula(stmt16)
solver.assertFormula(stmt17)
solver.assertFormula(stmt18)
solver.assertFormula(stmt19)
solver.assertFormula(stmt20)
solver.assertFormula(stmt21)
solver.assertFormula(stmt22)
solver.assertFormula(stmt23)
solver.assertFormula(stmt24)
solver.assertFormula(stmt25)
solver.assertFormula(test_stmt)

result = solver.checkSat()
print(f'Test Statement: The mouse does not see the cat - {result}')
```

In the final step, we assert each statement and the test statement to the CVC5 solver and check if the test statement is satisfied given the contextual information. The output will indicate whether the test statement is satisfied, unsatisfied, or if it can provide some other logical outcome based on the given facts.
