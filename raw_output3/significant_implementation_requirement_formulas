        Your task is to generate cvc5 python solver formulas for the constraints in each requirement ### SIGNIFICANT IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENT

- At least one course in your MS program should be designated as satisfying the Significant Implementation Requirement.
- Note that this course will also be used to satisfy some other requirement (i.e., Depth, or Elective).
- Must be taken for a letter grade,* must be taken at Stanford.
- Coterm students who took two of these courses at Stanford as undergraduates may waive this requirement.
- Deviations must be approved by the faculty director of the MS program, Cynthia Lee.

### Courses that may be used to satisfy the Significant Implementation Requirement include:
- CS 140, 140E, 143, 144, 145, 148, 151, 190, 210B, 212, 221, 227B, 231N, 243, 248/248A, and 341. you have identified.
        Your formulas should include every constraint, including the ones related to advisor approval and deviations.
        The formulas will check satisfiability of a given transcript schema template as input in the following format:

                "Graduate": Real,
        },
        }

        Given a transcript schema as input variables, please generate cvc5 smt solver formulas for each constraint in the

        =======================formula ouput===========================
To generate CVC5 solver formulas for the given constraints under the `SIGNIFICANT IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENT` section, we'll need to translate each requirement into appropriate CVC5 SMT constraints.

We'll instantiate necessary variables and progressively build terms to capture each constraint. Below is the Python code using CVC5 SMT solver API to achieve this:

```python
import cvc5
from cvc5 import Kind

# Create a solver instance
solver = cvc5.Solver()

# Function to check if a student meets the Significant Implementation Requirement
def check_significant_implementation_requirement(transcript):
    # List of courses satisfying the Significant Implementation Requirement
    implementation_courses = ['CS 140', 'CS 140E', 'CS 143', 'CS 144', 'CS 145', 'CS 148', 'CS 151', 'CS 190', 'CS 210B', 'CS 212', 'CS 221', 'CS 227B', 'CS 231N', 'CS 243', 'CS 248', 'CS 248A', 'CS 341']

    # Create a variable to represent a course from the transcript
    course_var = solver.mkConst(solver.getStringSort(), "course_var")
    
    # Constraint: At least one of the courses in the transcript satisfies the Significant Implementation Requirement
    implementation_constraint = [
        solver.mkTerm(Kind.EQUAL, course_var, solver.mkString(course.get("Title"))) for course in transcript.get("Courses_Taken", []) if course.get("Title") in implementation_courses
    ]
    significant_implementation_constraint = solver.mkTerm(Kind.OR, *implementation_constraint)

    # Constraint: The course must be taken for a letter grade at Stanford
    grade_constraint = [
        solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND,
                      solver.mkTerm(Kind.EQUAL, solver.mkString(course.get("Grade")), solver.mkString("A")),
                      solver.mkTerm(Kind.EQUAL, course_var, solver.mkString(course.get("Title")))) for course in transcript.get("Courses_Taken", []) if course.get("Title") in implementation_courses
    ]
    letter_grade_constraint = solver.mkTerm(Kind.OR, *grade_constraint)
    
    # Constraint: Ensure the course is taken at Stanford
    taken_at_stanford = solver.mkTrue()  # Assuming all courses are taken at Stanford by default as per input
    
    # Constraint: Coterm students who took two courses as undergraduates can waive this requirement
    coterm_var = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), "coterm_var")
    coterm_constraint = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, coterm_var, solver.mkTerm(
        Kind.LEQ,
        solver.mkInteger(len([course.get("Title") for course in transcript.get("Courses_Taken", []) if course.get("Title") in implementation_courses])),
        solver.mkInteger(2)))

    # Constraint: Deviations must be approved by Cynthia Lee
    deviation_approved_by_cynthia = [
        solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND,
                      solver.mkTerm(Kind.EQUAL, deviation.get("Approved_By"), solver.mkString("Cynthia Lee")),
                      solver.mkTerm(Kind.EQUAL, deviation.get("Approved"), solver.mkTrue())) for deviation in transcript.get("Deviations", [])
    ]
    deviation_constraint = solver.mkTerm(Kind.OR, *deviation_approved_by_cynthia)
    
    # Combine all constraints
    final_constraints = solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, significant_implementation_constraint, letter_grade_constraint, taken_at_stanford, coterm_constraint, deviation_constraint)
    
    # Assert the final constraints
    solver.assertFormula(final_constraints)
    
    # Check satisfiability
    result = solver.checkSat()
    return result

# Example transcript
transcript = {
    "Student": {
        "Name": "John Doe",
        "Program": "MS in CS",
        "StudentID": 123456,
        "Coterm": True
    },
    "AP_Credits": [],
    "Courses_Taken": [
        {"Course_ID": 1, "Title": "CS 140", "Earned_Units": 3, "Grade": "A"},
        {"Course_ID": 2, "Title": "CS 221", "Earned_Units": 3, "Grade": "A"}
    ],
    "Deviations": [
        {"Deviated_Course_ID": "None", "Approved": False, "Approved_By": "None"}
    ],
    "Approval": [
        {"Approved": True, "Approved_By": "Cynthia Lee", "Approved_Course_ID": "CS 221"}
    ],
    "Cumulative_GPA": {
        "Undergrad": 3.8,
        "Graduate": 3.9
    }
}

result = check_significant_implementation_requirement(transcript)
print("Satisfiable: ", result)
```

Note:
- This script uses the `cvc5` API to set up the constraints.
- The `Courses_Taken` section of the transcript is examined to ensure at least one course from the predefined list is present and meets the requirements.
- If the student is a coterminal student qualifying for a waiver, the constraints take that into account.
- Deviations from the requirement must have approval from Cynthia Lee, which is also validated.
- Each constraint is combined using logical operators and asserted to the solver, and then the satisfiability is checked.

Make sure you have installed the `cvc5` Python API before running this script. Adjust the transcript as needed to test different scenarios.
