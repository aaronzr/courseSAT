First, we'll import the necessary library and create a solver instance:

```python
import cvc5

solver = cvc5.Solver()
solver.setLogic("QF_UF")
```

### Define Variables

```python
# Objects
cat = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), "cat")
mouse = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), "mouse")
bald_eagle = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), "bald_eagle")
rabbit = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), "rabbit")
someone = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), "someone")

# Predicates
likes = solver.mkVar(solver.mkFunctionSort(solver.getBooleanSort(), solver.getBooleanSort()), "likes")
visits = solver.mkVar(solver.mkFunctionSort(solver.getBooleanSort(), solver.getBooleanSort()), "visits")
chases = solver.mkVar(solver.mkFunctionSort(solver.getBooleanSort(), solver.getBooleanSort()), "chases")
is_cold = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), "is_cold")
is_blue = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), "is_blue")
is_kind = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), "is_kind")
```
