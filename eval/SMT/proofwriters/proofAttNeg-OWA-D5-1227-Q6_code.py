Sure, let's break down each statement into logical formulas using cvc5 Python APIs. We will define predicates for various properties such as `big`, `green`, `round`, `blue`, `nice`, `furry`, and `cold`. These properties will be applied to different subjects like Anne, Bob, Charlie, and Gary. Finally, we will use the cvc5 SMT solver to evaluate the test statement.

First, let's define our domain and predicates in Python using cvc5:

```python
import cvc5
from cvc5 import Kind

# Create the solver
solver = cvc5.Solver()

# Set the logic
solver.setLogic("QF_UF")  # This logic is appropriate for uninterpreted functions and predicates.

# Define sorts (types) for individuals
Person = solver.mkUninterpretedSort("Person")

# Define individuals
Anne = solver.mkConst(Person, "Anne")
Bob = solver.mkConst(Person, "Bob")
Charlie = solver.mkConst(Person, "Charlie")
Gary = solver.mkConst(Person, "Gary")

# Define predicates
big = solver.mkPredicate(Person, "big")
green = solver.mkPredicate(Person, "green")
round_ = solver.mkPredicate(Person, "round")
blue = solver.mkPredicate(Person, "blue")
nice = solver.mkPredicate(Person, "nice")
furry = solver.mkPredicate(Person, "furry")
cold = solver.mkPredicate(Person, "cold")

# Function to simplify formula creation
def implies(a, b):
    return solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, a, b)

# Translate statements into formulas
# If something is big and green then it is not round.
statement1 = solver.mkForall([Person],
    implies(solver.mkAnd([big(Person), green(Person)]), solver.mkNot(round_(Person))))

# Blue, nice things are round.
statement2 = solver.mkForall([Person],
    implies(solver.mkAnd([blue(Person), nice(Person)]), round_(Person)))

# If Bob is furry then Bob is green.
statement3 = implies(furry(Bob), green(Bob))

# All cold, blue things are furry.
statement4 = solver.mkForall([Person],
    implies(solver.mkAnd([cold(Person), blue(Person)]), furry(Person)))

# Nice things are big.
statement5 = solver.mkForall([Person], implies(nice(Person), big(Person)))

# All round, cold things are not green.
statement6 = solver.mkForall([Person], implies(solver.mkAnd([round_(Person), cold(Person)]), solver.mkNot(green(Person))))

# Green, cold things are not nice.
statement7 = solver.mkForall([Person], implies(solver.mkAnd([green(Person), cold(Person)]), solver.mkNot(nice(Person))))

# If something is cold then it is nice.
statement8 = solver.mkForall([Person], implies(cold(Person), nice(Person)))

# Big things are blue.
statement9 = solver.mkForall([Person], implies(big(Person), blue(Person)))

# Individual statements
anne_is_cold = cold(Anne)
anne_is_round = round_(Anne)
bob_is_blue = blue(Bob)
bob_is_round = round_(Bob)
charlie_is_blue = blue(Charlie)
charlie_is_nice = nice(Charlie)
gary_is_cold = cold(Gary)

# Collect all the assertions
solver.assertFormula(statement1)
solver.assertFormula(statement2)
solver.assertFormula(statement3)
solver.assertFormula(statement4)
solver.assertFormula(statement5)
solver.assertFormula(statement6)
solver.assertFormula(statement7)
solver.assertFormula(statement8)
solver.assertFormula(statement9)
solver.assertFormula(anne_is_cold)
solver.assertFormula(anne_is_round)
solver.assertFormula(bob_is_blue)
solver.assertFormula(bob_is_round)
solver.assertFormula(charlie_is_blue)
solver.assertFormula(charlie_is_nice)
solver.assertFormula(gary_is_cold)

# Test statement: Gary is not big.
test_statement = solver.mkNot(big(Gary))

# Check the satisfiability of relevant test statements
solver.assertFormula(test_statement)

# Check satisfiability
result = solver.checkSat()

# Output the result
print(f"The test statement 'Gary is not big' is: {result}")
```

We have now translated all statements into cvc5 Python formulas and created a test case to check whether "Gary is not big" is satisfiable given the context. You can run this code in an environment with cvc5 installed to evaluate the given logical conditions.
