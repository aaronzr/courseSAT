course_units = Sure! Based on the provided text, here is a Python list of course units from the document. The courses and their respective units are inferred from the provided text. If units are explicitly mentioned, they are added; otherwise, a standard assumption of 3-5 units for most courses is made. However, you may have to adjust the units according to the specific course catalog.

Here is a list based on the given requirements:

```python
course_units = [
    5,  # cs106b_units (Assuming CS 106B follows the same requirement as CS 103 which is 5 units)
    3,  # engr40m_units (Making an assumption as units are not explicitly mentioned)
    3,  # engr76_units (Assumed similar to the other Engineering course)
    5,  # cs103_units
    5,  # cs109_units
    5,  # cs107_units or cs107e_units (Assuming one of these is taken)
    4,  # cs111_units
    4,  # cs161_units
    4,  # cs221_units
]
```

Note: The units for `engr40m_units` and `engr76_units` are assumed to be 3. You may need to verify this with actual course data as exact units are not specified in the provided text.

If you have explicit unit values for each course, please adjust the list accordingly.
