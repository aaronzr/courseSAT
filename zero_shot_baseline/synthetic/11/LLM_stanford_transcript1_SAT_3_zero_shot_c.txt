### Breadth Requirement
- **Area A**: Not mentioned if taken. Need an additional course from the specified list in the category.
- **Area B**: Not mentioned if taken. Need an additional course from the specified list in the category.
- **Area C**: CS 246 - Mining Massive Datasets (taken, verified).
- **Area D**: ANTHRO 132D taken as part of undergraduate but documented requirement for MS needs specifying.

### AI Depth Courses
1. **CS 221**: Completed with A-.
2. **CS 224N**: Completed with B+.
3. **CS 228**: Completed with B+.

Since the specific details about Breadth courses Area A and Area B are missing, **the transcript does not yet meet the requirements for the MS**. 

**Output**: List unsatisfied courses:
1. Breadth Requirement:
   - Area A
   - Area B
