This synthetic transcript deliberately includes courses and grades designed to not comply with the actual course requirements for a BS in CS or AI specialization at Stanford. For instance, the course grades include a mix of lower grades and unrelated electives, and certain required CS courses have been assigned non-passing grades or not included.
