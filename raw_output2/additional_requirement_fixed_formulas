        Please optimize your generated solver formulas by minimizing the use of
        for loops or if condition checks. The following example is an okay format, because we use a variable in the formula
        to parameterize the formulas as input to the solver: 
        ```python
        variable = solver.mkConst(solver.getStringSort(), "course")
        constraint_1 = [solver.mkTerm(Kind.EQUAL, solver.mkString(course.get("Course_ID")), solver.mkString(variable)) for course in transcript.get("Courses_Taken", [])]
        constraint_2 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.EQUAL, solver.mkString(variable), solver.mkString("CS 221"))
        formula = solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, constraint_1, constraint_2)
        ```
        The following example is NOT an okay format, because the formula is using hard coded values and is NOT parameterized: 
        ```python 
        for course in transcript.get("Courses_Taken", []):
                cs_221 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.EQUAL, solver.mkString(course.get("Course_ID")), solver.mkString("CS 221"))
        ```
        Please check the following out and convert for loops and if conditional checks into 
        solver formulas when possible: =======================prompt===========================

Sure, let's structure the constraints following the parameterized approach that minimizes loops and conditionals.

We'll need to create a solver instance and generate formulas for each of the constraints specified in the "ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS" section. Here's how you can do it:

### Explanation:

1. **Course Numbering**:
   - Iterate over each course and ensure its `Course_ID` is 100 or greater.

2. **Foundation Units**:
   - For each course, check if it's a foundation course and count the units, limit to 10 units.

3. **Seminar Units**:
   - Count the units for seminars (1-2 units) and limit them to 3 units.

4. **Letter Grade Units**:
   - Identify courses taken for a letter grade (including CR/S under specific conditions) and ensure they total at least 36 units.

5. **Average GPA**:
   - Calculate the GPA weighted by the units and ensure it is at least 3.0.

6. **No Double Counting**:
   - Ensure there are no units counted towards both BS and MSCS requirements.

7. **Total Graduate Units**:
   - Ensure at least 45 units are completed for the MSCS degree.

Each constraint is formulated using `solver.mkTerm` and `solver.mkTerm`. The final constraint checks are combined using `solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND)` and asserted as a single formula.
