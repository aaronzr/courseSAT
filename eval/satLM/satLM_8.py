To convert the given constraints into Z3Py (a Python API for the Z3 Theorem Prover), here's how we can formulate it:

```python
from z3 import *

# Define the students and cities
Students = [Hubert, Lori, Paul, Regina, Sharon]
Cities = [Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver]

# Create a function for visit which maps each student to a city
visit = Function('visit', IntSort(), IntSort())

# Define constants for the students
Hubert, Lori, Paul, Regina, Sharon = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

# Define constants for the cities
Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver = 0, 1, 2

# Create the solver
solver = Solver()

# Add constraints based on the problem description
solver.add(visit(Sharon) != visit(Paul))                            # Sharon visits a different city than Paul
solver.add(visit(Hubert) == visit(Regina))                          # Hubert visits the same city as Regina
solver.add(Or(visit(Lori) == Montreal, visit(Lori) == Toronto))     # Lori visits Montreal or else Toronto
solver.add(Implies(visit(Paul) == Vancouver, visit(Hubert) == Vancouver)) # If Paul visits Vancouver, Hubert visits Vancouver with him.
solver.add(visit(0) != visit(1), visit(0) != visit(2), visit(0) != visit(3), visit(0) != visit(4), # Hubert's distinct city condition
           visit(1) != visit(2), visit(1) != visit(3))               # each student  visits one of the cities with at least one of the other four students

# Define what must be true for March based on the question choices:
choice_A = Implies(Or([visit(student) == Montreal for student in Students]), visit(Lori) == Montreal)
choice_B = Implies(Or([visit(student) == Montreal for student in Students]), Sum([If(visit(student) == Montreal, 1, 0) for student in Students]) == 2)
choice_C = Implies(Or([visit(student) == Toronto for student in Students]), Sum([If(visit(student) == Toronto, 1, 0) for student in Students]) == 3)
choice_D = Implies(Or([visit(student) == Vancouver for student in Students]), visit(Paul) == Vancouver)
choice_E = Implies(Or([visit(student) == Vancouver for student in Students]), Sum([If(visit(student) == Vancouver, 1, 0) for student in Students]) == 3)

# Print which condition must be true
for idx, choice in enumerate([choice_A, choice_B, choice_C, choice_D, choice_E]):
    solver.push()
    solver.add(Not(choice))
    if solver.check() == unsat:
        print("Choice {} is true".format("ABCDE"[idx]))
    solver.pop()
```

This script uses Z3's Python API to define the students and cities as integers, set up the conditions based on the problem statement, and check which of the given choices must be true.

In particular:
- We defined `visit` as a function mapping each student to a city.
- Set up the constraints based on the problem.
- For each choice, we checked if the negation of the choice makes the constraint system unsatisfiable using the solver. If it does, it means that the original choice must be true.

This will help determine which statement out of the given options must be true for March, as per the given conditions.
