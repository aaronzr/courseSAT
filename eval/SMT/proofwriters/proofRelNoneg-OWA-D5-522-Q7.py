['If something eats the bear then it is green.', 'All big things are green.', 'If something is red and it likes the dog then the dog is rough.', 'If something is rough and it sees the tiger then it is big.', 'If something sees the dog and the dog is green then it sees the tiger.', 'If something eats the dog and the dog is big then it is kind.', 'If something is kind and rough then it eats the tiger.', 'If something eats the rabbit and it likes the tiger then it sees the tiger.', 'If something sees the tiger then the tiger eats the dog.', 'The bear is big.', 'The bear sees the dog.', 'The dog eats the bear.', 'The dog eats the rabbit.', 'The dog is big.', 'The rabbit eats the tiger.', 'The rabbit likes the dog.', 'The rabbit sees the dog.', 'The tiger is big.', 'The tiger is rough.', 'The tiger likes the dog.']The tiger eats the dog.To translate these natural language statements into CVC5 SMT Python formulas, we first need to define a few parameters and predicates that will help us express these statements in logical form.

Here are some predicates we will use:
- `Eats(x, y)`: x eats y
- `Likes(x, y)`: x likes y
- `Sees(x, y)`: x sees y
- `IsBig(x)`: x is big
- `IsGreen(x)`: x is green
- `IsRed(x)`: x is red
- `IsRough(x)`: x is rough
- `IsKind(x)`: x is kind

We'll also need some variables for the various entities:
- `bear`, `dog`, `rabbit`, `tiger`

Now, let's go ahead and translate each statement.

### Contextual Statements

1. **If something eats the bear then it is green.**
    - `∀x (Eats(x, bear) → IsGreen(x))`

2. **All big things are green.**
    - `∀x (IsBig(x) → IsGreen(x))`

3. **If something is red and it likes the dog then the dog is rough.**
    - `∀x (IsRed(x) ∧ Likes(x, dog) → IsRough(dog))`

4. **If something is rough and it sees the tiger then it is big.**
    - `∀x (IsRough(x) ∧ Sees(x, tiger) → IsBig(x))`

5. **If something sees the dog and the dog is green then it sees the tiger.**
    - `∀x (Sees(x, dog) ∧ IsGreen(dog) → Sees(x, tiger))`

6. **If something eats the dog and the dog is big then it is kind.**
    - `∀x (Eats(x, dog) ∧ IsBig(dog) → IsKind(x))`

7. **If something is kind and rough then it eats the tiger.**
    - `∀x (IsKind(x) ∧ IsRough(x) → Eats(x, tiger))`

8. **If something eats the rabbit and it likes the tiger then it sees the tiger.**
    - `∀x (Eats(x, rabbit) ∧ Likes(x, tiger) → Sees(x, tiger))`

9. **If something sees the tiger then the tiger eats the dog.**
    - `∀x (Sees(x, tiger) → Eats(tiger, dog))`

10. **The bear is big.**
    - `IsBig(bear)`

11. **The bear sees the dog.**
    - `Sees(bear, dog)`

12. **The dog eats the bear.**
    - `Eats(dog, bear)`

13. **The dog eats the rabbit.**
    - `Eats(dog, rabbit)`

14. **The dog is big.**
    - `IsBig(dog)`

15. **The rabbit eats the tiger.**
    - `Eats(rabbit, tiger)`

16. **The rabbit likes the dog.**
    - `Likes(rabbit, dog)`

17. **The rabbit sees the dog.**
    - `Sees(rabbit, dog)`

18. **The tiger is big.**
    - `IsBig(tiger)`

19. **The tiger is rough.**
    - `IsRough(tiger)`

20. **The tiger likes the dog.**
    - `Likes(tiger, dog)`

### Test Statement
- **The tiger eats the dog.**
    - `Eats(tiger, dog)`

### Python code using cvc5 SMT solver:
Here is how you might code this in Python with the cvc5 SMT solver:

```python
import cvc5
from cvc5 import Solver, Kind

solver = Solver()

# Define sorts
animal = solver.mkUninterpretedSort("Animal")

# Define variables
bear = solver.mkConst(animal, "bear")
dog = solver.mkConst(animal, "dog")
rabbit = solver.mkConst(animal, "rabbit")
tiger = solver.mkConst(animal, "tiger")

# Define predicates
Eats = solver.mkFunction("Eats", [animal, animal], solver.getBooleanSort())
Likes = solver.mkFunction("Likes", [animal, animal], solver.getBooleanSort())
Sees = solver.mkFunction("Sees", [animal, animal], solver.getBooleanSort())
IsBig = solver.mkFunction("IsBig", [animal], solver.getBooleanSort())
IsGreen = solver.mkFunction("IsGreen", [animal], solver.getBooleanSort())
IsRed = solver.mkFunction("IsRed", [animal], solver.getBooleanSort())
IsRough = solver.mkFunction("IsRough", [animal], solver.getBooleanSort())
IsKind = solver.mkFunction("IsKind", [animal], solver.getBooleanSort())

# Define helper function to create implications
def implies(p, q):
    return solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, p, q)

# Contextual statements
solver.assertFormula(implies(Eats(bear, bear), IsGreen(bear)))
solver.assertFormula(implies(IsBig(bear), IsGreen(bear)))
solver.assertFormula(implies(solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, IsRed(bear), Likes(bear, dog)), IsRough(dog)))
solver.assertFormula(implies(solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, IsRough(bear), Sees(bear, tiger)), IsBig(bear)))
solver.assertFormula(implies(solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, Sees(bear, dog), IsGreen(dog)), Sees(bear, tiger)))
solver.assertFormula(implies(solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, Eats(bear, dog), IsBig(dog)), IsKind(bear)))
solver.assertFormula(implies(solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, IsKind(bear), IsRough(bear)), Eats(bear, tiger)))
solver.assertFormula(implies(solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, Eats(bear, rabbit), Likes(bear, tiger)), Sees(bear, tiger)))
solver.assertFormula(implies(Sees(bear, tiger), Eats(tiger, dog)))

solver.assertFormula(IsBig(bear))
solver.assertFormula(Sees(bear, dog))
solver.assertFormula(Eats(dog, bear))
solver.assertFormula(Eats(dog, rabbit))
solver.assertFormula(IsBig(dog))
solver.assertFormula(Eats(rabbit, tiger))
solver.assertFormula(Likes(rabbit, dog))
solver.assertFormula(Sees(rabbit, dog))
solver.assertFormula(IsBig(tiger))
solver.assertFormula(IsRough(tiger))
solver.assertFormula(Likes(tiger, dog))

# Test statement 
test_statement = Eats(tiger, dog)

# Check satisfiability
result = solver.checkSatAssuming(test_statement)

# Output the result
print("The statement 'The tiger eats the dog.' is", result)
```

This code creates a cvc5 solver, defines the relevant sorts, variables, predicates, and helper functions, asserts the contextual statements, and checks the test statement to see if it is satisfiable or not. The output will show whether the statement "The tiger eats the dog." is satisfiable given the context.
