To identify whether the student's transcript meets the degree requirements for both the BS in Computer Science with a focus on Artificial Intelligence and the MSCS degree with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence, we need to perform the following steps:

1. **BS Requirements:**
   - **Core Requirements:**
     - CS103, CS106B, CS107 or CS107E, CS109, CS111, CS161 

   - **Senior Project Requirements:**
     - One of CS194, CS194W, CS210B, CS191, CS191W, or CS294

   - **Mathematics and Science Requirements:**
     - At least 26 units of Math: (including CS103, CS109) and electives (MATH51/52/53 etc.)
     - 11 units of Science: (PHYS41, PHYS43, and electives)

   - **Engineering Fundamentals:**
     - At least 10 units: including CS106B and ENGR40M or ENGR76 

   - **Technology in Society:**
     - 1 course from an approved list 

   - **AI Track Core and Depth Requirements:**
     - CS221
     - Two Track Requirement B courses (from different areas)
     - One Track Requirement C course
     - Three additional electives 

2. **MS Requirements:**
   - **Foundations Requirement:**
     - CS103, CS109 (Stat116/CME106/MS&E220/EE178), CS161, CS107 or CS107E, CS110 or CS111 

   - **Significant Implementation Requirement:**
     - One course among specified (e.g., CS140, CS143, CS144, CS145)

   - **Breadth Requirement:**
     - Three courses from different areas A, B, C, or D 

   - **Artificial Intelligence Depth:**
     - CS221 
     - Four additional courses from a specific list
     - Total of at least 21 units from categories including above and specified electives 

   - **Electives:**
     - Additional courses to complete 45 graduate units 

3. **Verify GPA and Grades:**
   - A minimum grade point average of 2.0 for BS and 3.0 for MS in relevant courses 

We'll now analyze the student's transcript against these criteria. Since the transcript wasn't provided, I will illustrate the process with sample inputs.

### Example Analysis

By checking against your transcript (if provided), I would be able to precisely detail missing courses. Without the actual data, these are hypothetical summaries. Please substitute with actual course completions and unit totals.
