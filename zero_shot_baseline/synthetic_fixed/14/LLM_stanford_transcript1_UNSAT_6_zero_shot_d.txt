END OF TRANSCRIPT.
==================================================================GPT Answer to Prompt One Regarding BS Requirements====================
Based on the provided Stanford Computer Science BS degree requirements and Alicia Marie Jackson's transcript, we will evaluate each area to see if her requirements are satisfied.

### Core Requirements:
1. **CS103 - Mathematical Foundations of Computing:** Not Found in transcript
2. **CS107 - Computer Organization and Systems:** Grade D- (must be retaken for a minimum grade of C-)
3. **CS109 - Introduction to Probability for Computer Scientists:** Not Found in transcript
4. **CS111 - Operating Systems:** Grade C (satisfied)
5. **CS161 - Data Structures and Algorithms:** Grade C+ (satisfied)

### Mathematics Requirements:
1. **MATH 19/20/21 Series or equivalent:**
   - MATH 51 (Linear Algebra & Differential Equations): C (equivalent satisfied)

2. **CS103 - Mathematical Foundations of Computing:** Not Found in transcript
3. **CS109 - Introduction to Probability for Computer Scientists:** Not Found in transcript
4. **Two Advanced Math Electives:**
   - MATH 103 (Introduction to Complex Variables): B+ (satisfied)
   - PHIL 151 (Philosophy of Mathematics): A- (satisfied)

### Science Requirements:
1. **PHYSICS 41 - Mechanics:** Physics credit from AP or PHYSICS 61 A- (satisfied)
2. **PHYSICS 43 - Electricity and Magnetism:** PHYSICS 63 C+ (satisfied, but not optimal)
3. **Science Elective:**
   - BIOLOGY 82 Genetics: B (satisfied)

### Engineering Fundamentals:
1. **CS106B - Programming Abstractions:** B- (satisfied)
2. **ENGR 40M or ENGR 76:**
   - EE 102 (for EE requirement): B (satisfied)

### Technology in Society Requirement:
1. **One course from the approved Technology in Society list:**
   - CS 134 (Ethics and Technology): B+ (satisfied)

### CS Depth Requirements:
1. **CS107 - Computer Organization and Systems:** Grade D- (must be retaken)
2. **CS111 - Operating Systems Principles:** Satisfied by CS111 with C
3. **CS161 - Data Structures and Algorithms:** C+ (satisfied)

### Track Requirements (AI Track):
1. **CS221 - AI: Principles and Techniques:** Not Found in transcript
2. **Track Requirement B:**
   - CS 124 (From Languages to Information): D+ (must be retaken)
   - CS 238 (Machine Learning in Healthcare): B (satisfied)
3. **Track Requirement C:** Not Found in transcript, but not necessarily mentioned in provided choices as fulfilled.

### Senior Project:
1. CS 210B (Project Experience with Corporate Partners): Grade C (satisfied)

### Minimum GPA requirement:
Must have 2.0 GPA in all ENGR Fundamentals, CS Core, Depth, and Senior Project combined. Alicia's GPA appears slightly below 2.0 in some core CS subjects indicating CS107 and CS124 greatly affect cumulative GPA and therefore may need to be retaken to ensure a higher GPA.

Based on above verification:
- **Courses not satisfied:**
  1. CS103 - Mathematical Foundations of Computing (not found)
  2. CS109 - Introduction to Probability for Computer Scientists (not found)
  3. CS107 - Computer Organization and Systems (D-)
  4. CS107 - AI: Principles and Techniques (not found)
  5. CS124 - From Languages to Information (D+)
  6. CS230 - Deep Learning (F can be ignored as AI elective not met)

### Conclusion:
Please retake and satisfy the above mentioned unsatisfied core and elective courses.

**Output:** 
- "CS103 - Mathematical Foundations of Computing"
- "CS109 - Introduction to Probability for Computer Scientists"
- "CS107 - Computer Organization and Systems"
- "CS221 - AI: Principles and Techniques"
- "CS124 - From Languages to Information".
========================GPT Answer to Prompt Two Regarding MS Requirements====================
Based on the provided student transcript and the MSCS degree (Artificial Intelligence Specialization) requirements, let's analyze whether the student, Alicia Marie Jackson, has satisfied the MS requirements. 

Here's a breakdown:

### Foundations Requirement:
- **Logic, Automata & Complexity (CS103):** Not satisfied.
- **Probability (CS109, Stat116, CME106, MS&E220, or EE178):** Not satisfied (EE 203 is a substitute but was not mentioned in acceptable courses).
- **Algorithmic Analysis (CS161) - Grade: C+:** Satisfied.
- **Computer Organization & Sys (CS107 or 107E) - Grade: D- (Undergrad):** Satisfied (Required grade condition for undergrad transfers not specified, but it is listed).
- **Principles of Computer Systems (CS110 or CS111) - Grade: C (CS111, Undergrad):** Satisfied.

### Significant Implementation Requirement:
- **CS 210B Project Experience with Corporate Partners - Grade: C** (Listed, provided it is a valid significant implementation course). Satisfied.

### Breadth Requirement:
Three courses from different areas:
- **Area A (Mathematical and Theoretical Foundations):** Not listed.
- **Area B (Computer Systems): CS 140 Operating Systems (5 units) - Grade: F (Undergrad):** Not satisfied.
- **Area C (Applications): CS 245 Big Data Systems (3 units) - Grade: B:** Satisfied.
- **Area D (Computing and Society):** Not listed.

### Artificial Intelligence Specialization Depth:
- **CS 221 (required):** Not listed.
- **At least four additional courses (see list): CS 210B Project Experience, CS 238 Machine Learning in Healthcare (3 units) - Grade: B:** Satisfied.
- **Total of 21 units from specified courses:** Document list shows 8 units of acceptable courses (excluding those undergrad courses). The requirement is not satisfied.

### Electives:
- Courses listed must fulfill remaining units to 45. The document shows multiple courses but without a tally. Approximation shows insufficiency but detailed analysis required.

### Additional Requirements (Summary):
1. **36 units must be for a letter grade:** Some courses detailed as taken (potentially) CR but unclear on total tally.
2. **Must complete at least 45 graduate units:** The record does not specify.
3. **Minimum GPA 3.0:** The MS GPA listed is missing; Undergraduate GPA is 2.664 for reference.

### Final Verdicts:
- **Foundation Requirement:** Not satisfied (Logic, Automata & Complexity, Probability).
- **Significant Implementation:** Satisfied.
- **Breadth Requirement:** Not satisfied (only one of three categories satisfied).
- **AI Depth:** Not satisfied (less than four courses plus total unit requirement not met).
- **Electives/Totals:** Not fully assessable without a proper tally.

### Output:
```
MS NOT SAT
Courses Missing:
- Logic, Automata & Complexity (CS103)
- Probability (CS109, Stat116, CME106, MS&E220, or EE178)
- Area A Breadth Course
- Area D Breadth Course
- CS 221
- At least four AI depth courses from the list
- Total 21 units for AI depth
- Total units for Elective requirement to complete 45 units
- Ensure Minimum GPA (if failing grades impact)
```

Without complete granular data on final course work, elective units, and accurate GPA assessment post-transition crucial details, it is crucial to revalidate against official records.
