==========================================### Analysis of BS Degree Requirements:

**Core Requirements:**
1. **Systems:**
   - CS106B: Completed (B-)
   - CS107: Completed (C+)
   - CS111: Completed (C+)

2. **Theory:**
   - CS103: Completed (D+)
   - CS109: Completed (D)
   - CS161: Not completed (F)

**Senior Project:**
- None of the senior project courses are indicated as completed on the transcript. No CS194, CS194W, CS210B, CS191, or CS191W mentioned.

**GPA Requirement:**
- The required courses in Core, Depth, and Senior Project combined must have a minimum GPA of 2.0. With low grades in core courses and lacking completion of senior project and depth requirements, it seems this is not satisfied.

**Summary of BS Requirement Gaps:**
1. **Core Requirement:**
   - CS161 needs to be passed.
   
2. **Senior Project:**
   - Completion of an applicable senior project course such as CS194, CS194W, CS210B, CS191, or CS191W.

**Output:**
- "CS161"
- "Incomplete Senior Project"

Based on the above, the BS degree requirements are **not satisfied**.

### Analysis of MS Degree Requirements (Artificial Intelligence Specialization):

**Foundations Requirement:**
1. **Logic, Automata & Complexity (CS 103)** - Needs approval since grade is D+.
2. **Probability (CS 109)** - Needs approval since grade is D.
3. **Algorithmic Analysis (CS 161)** - Needs to be completed successfully.
4. **Computer Organization & Systems (CS 107)** - Completed. (C+)
5. **Principles of Computer Systems (CS 111)** - Completed. (C+)

**Significant Implementation Requirement:**
- Not indicated whether any course marked satisfies this requirement. Need to complete one from the specified list in MS program.

**Breadth Requirement:**
- No indication on the transcript. Three breadth courses from Areas A, B, C, and D still needed.

**Artificial Intelligence Depth:**
a) CS 221: Failed (F)
b) Four courses from specified AI options: CS 124 (D+), CS 224N (F), CS 123 (C). Remaining courses not taken or failed.

**Electives:**
- Insufficient details on elective courses completed towards MS.

**Summary of MS Requirement Gaps:**
1. **Foundations Requirement:**
   - CS103 & CS109 grade approval or retake for better grades.
   - CS161 needs to be passed.
  
2. **Significant Implementation Requirement:**
   - Needs completion.
   
3. **Breadth Requirement:**
   - Three breadth courses need to be completed.
   
4. **Artificial Intelligence Depth Requirement:**
   - Pass failing courses or take additional courses from prescribed options.
   
5. **Electives:**
   - Complete additional electives to meet 45-unit requirement.

**Output:**
- "Foundations Requirement (CS103, CS109, CS161)"
- "Significant Implementation Requirement"
- "Breadth Requirement"
- "AI Depth Requirement"
- "Electives"

Based on the above, the MS degree requirements are **not satisfied**.

Thus, the final outputs are:
- **BS degree**: Courses not satisfied.
  - "CS161"
  - "Incomplete Senior Project"

- **MS degree**: Courses not satisfied.
  - "Foundations Requirement (CS103, CS109, CS161)"
  - "Significant Implementation Requirement"
  - "Breadth Requirement"
  - "AI Depth Requirement"
  - "Electives"
