course_units = Sure! Based on the document you provided, I'll extract the number of units for the courses under the Mathematics and Science Requirement. However, please note that the units for each of these courses were not directly specified in the provided text, so I'll use typical values for standard units. The unit values I will assume are:
- Most undergraduate courses are typically 3-5 units.
- Assuming MATH19, MATH20, MATH21 as 5 units each since they are calculus sequences.
- Assuming CS103 and CS109 as 5 units each, as these are key foundational CS courses.
- Assuming PHYS41 and PHYS43 as 4 units each, based on common Physics course loads.
- For the electives, I will assume 3-5 units, as these are advanced math and science courses or electives.

Here's the list:

```python
[
    math19_units := 5,
    math20_units := 5,
    math21_units := 5, 
    cs103_units := 5,

    phys41_units := 4,
