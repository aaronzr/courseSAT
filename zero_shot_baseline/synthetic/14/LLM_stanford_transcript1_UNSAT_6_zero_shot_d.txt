### Unmet Requirements and Areas of Concern
- **CS 103** and **CS 109** - Not found in transcript.
- **Depth requirements for Track B and C**, **Electives** - Not all specified courses are found in the provided transcript.
- **Minimum GPA of 2.0** in ENGR Fundamentals, CS Core, Depth, and Senior Project combined - Average GPA check needed.
- **Technology in Society Requirement** - No record found in the transcript.

### Conclusion
Since several critical courses and units are unmet or missing, and specific GPA checks and depth requirements are not fully verifiable:

- **CS 103 (5 units)**
- **CS 109 (5 units)**
- **CS 221 (AI: Principles and Techniques)**
- **Track Requirement B and C**
- **Minimum GPA of 2.0 check needed**
- **Technology in Society Requirement**

### Output
```
Courses not satisfied:
- CS 103
- CS 109
- CS 221
- Track Requirement B (at least two courses)
- Track Requirement C (one course)
- Technology in Society Requirement
- Ensure minimum GPA of 2.0 in ENGR Fundamentals, CS Core, Depth, and Senior Project combined.
```
========================GPT Answer to Prompt Two Regarding MS Requirements====================
The given transcript of Alicia Marie Jackson needs to be thoroughly examined against the "Artificial Intelligence Specialization" requirements for the MS in Computer Science (MSCS) at Stanford University. Below, I will identify each category of requirements and check whether the student has met them.

## Foundation Requirements
- Logic, Automata & Complexity: Not explicitly fulfilled in the UG transcript.
- Probability (CS109, Stat116, CME106, MS&E220, or EE178):
  - EE 203 (Probability and Random Processes): **Grade C+**
- Algorithmic Analysis (CS161):
  - CS 161 (Data Structures and Algorithms): **Grade C+**
- Computer Organization & Systems (CS107 or 107E):
  - CS 107 (Computer Organization and Systems): **Grade D-**
- Principles of Computer Systems (CS110 or CS111):
  - CS 111 (Operating Systems): **Grade C**

*Summary:* The transcript shows poor grades in essential foundation courses: CS 107 (D-) and CS 161 (C+). 

## Significant Implementation Requirement
The significant implementation requirement mandates the completion of at least one course from the prescribed list, taken for a letter grade:
- CS 140 (Operating Systems and Systems Programming): **Grade F** indicates failure.
- CS 210B (Project Experience with Corporate Partners): **Grade C**

*Summary:* CS 210B meets the significant implementation requirement but is on the borderline with a grade C.

## Breadth Requirement
Three courses, one from each different Breadth area A, B, C, or D:
- **Area A**: Mathematical and Theoretical Foundations (Math 51, 52, CS 154, etc.):
  - MATH 51 and MATH 52 are taken, grades **C** and **B-** respectively.
- **Area B**: Computer Systems:
  - ee 102 (Logic Design): **Grade B**
- **Area C**: Applications:
  - ee 222 (Quantum Mechanics): **Grade D**
- **Area D**: Computing and Society:
  - CS 134 (Ethics and Technology): **Grade B+**

*Summary:* No distinct course identified firmly in Area A, B, and C. The grades and subject matches are suboptimal.

## Artificial Intelligence Depth
- **a)** CS 221 (waived by adviser): Not explicitly mentioned.
- **b)** Four of the following:
  - CS 156: **Grade D+** (Machine Learning)
  - CS 238: **Grade B** (Machine Learning in Healthcare, partially applicable)

*Summary:* The depth requirements are not sufficiently fulfilled. Only CS 238 meets the requirement with a decent grade.

## Electives and Other Requirements
Total Units: At least 45 units for MSCS are required.
- There is a lack of clear elective units and exact application towards the MSCS in terms of matching the elective criteria.
- Overall GPA requirement of B (3.0): Current GPA of around 2.594 does not satisfy this.

**Conclusion**: Based on the provided transcript data:
- **Poor Grades** in foundational requirement courses.
- **Fail** in some significant AI Depth areas.
- **Inadequate fulfillment** of elective units and insufficient adjustment for the Breadth requirement courses.
- **Overall GPA below 3.0**.

**MS SATISFACTION STATUS**: **NOT SAT** 

**Courses or Areas Not Satisfied**:
1. **Foundation Courses**:
   - Logic, Automata & Complexity: Not clearly taken.
   - CS 107 needs re-evaluation or improvement.
   - CS 161 (C+ should be better evaluated).
2. **Breadth Courses**:
   - Suitable courses more distinctly.
3. **Depth Requirements**:
   - CS depth courses have insufficient performance and clarity in units.
4. **Overall GPA**:
   - Does not meet â‰¥3.0.

Hence, Alicia Marie Jackson does not meet the MSCS degree specialization requirements.
