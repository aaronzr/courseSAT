### Conclusion:

**Jeremy Lee Bregman's transcript indicates a strong performance in Electrical Engineering with cum GPA of 3.649 for undergraduate courses and 3.740 for graduate courses.** However, based on the provided transcript, Jeremy does not meet all the foundational requirements for the MSCS program specialization in Artificial Intelligence, particularly in the areas of Algorithmic Analysis, Logic, Automata & Complexity, and Principles of Computer Systems.

**Foundational Requirements Met:**
- Probability (CME 106)

**Foundational Requirements Not Met:**
- Logic, Automata & Complexity
- Algorithmic Analysis
- Computer Organization & Systems
- Principles of Computer Systems

**Courses Satisfying Depth, Electives, and Breadth:**
- Depth: Some courses already taken; others may need to be chosen based on requirements.
- Breadth: At least one course in Area B.
- Electives: Various courses in the graduate program.

**Recommendation:** Jeremy needs to take specific courses from the foundations requirement, as well as fulfill all significant implementation and breadth requirements, ensuring courses are taken for a letter grade wherever mandated. Additional depth courses must be chosen based on the AI specialization requirements to ensure compliance with the 45-unit MSCS requirement.
