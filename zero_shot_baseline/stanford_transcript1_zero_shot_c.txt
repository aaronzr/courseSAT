### BS Degree Requirements Analysis

#### Core Requirements: 
- **CS103**: Not taken by the student.
- **CS106B**: Taken and passed with a grade of B.
- **CS107**: Not taken by the student.
- **CS109**: Not taken by the student.
- **CS111**: Not taken by the student.
- **CS161**: Not taken by the student.

#### Senior Project Requirements:
- Only EE 191 is noted in the transcript, but it is not equivalent to the CS senior project requirement courses like CS194, 194W, 191, 191W, 210B.

#### Elective Requirements for AI Track:
- Math and Science Requirements:
  - **Mathematics (26 units minimum)**: 
    - MATH19-21 (AP Credit, 10 units), CME 100 (5 units), CME 102 (5 units), CME 104 (5 units), CS103 (Not taken), CS109 (Not taken), Mathematics electives (None mentioned).
    - Total units so far: 25/26
  
  - **Science (11 units minimum)**:
    - PHYSICS 41 (4 units), PHYSICS 43 (4 units), PHYSICS 45 (4 units)
    - Total units: 12/11

#### Technology in Society:
- Taken MS&E 193, which counts towards this requirement.

#### Engineering Fundamentals (10 units minimum):
- ENGR 40 taken and passed with B+, CS106B taken and passed with B.
- Total: 10 units satisfied.

### Key Points of Incomplete Requirements:
1. **Core Courses**:
   - CS103
   - CS107
   - CS109
   - CS111
   - CS161

2. **Senior Project**:
   - No senior project equivalent is found on the transcript.

**Conclusion**: Given that the core computer science courses (CS103, CS107, CS109, CS111, CS161) and the senior project course have not been completed, the BS degree requirements are **not satisfied**.

**Output**: 

```
- CS103: Missing
- CS107: Missing
- CS109: Missing
- CS111: Missing
- CS161: Missing
- CS Senior Project: Missing
```

### MS Specialization Requirements Analysis

Let's analyze the transcript against MS AI specialization:

#### Foundations Requirement:
- Logic, Automata & Complexity (CS103): Missing
- Probability (CS109, Stat116, CME106, MS&E220, or EE178): CME 106 (B+), satisfied.
- Algorithmic Analysis (CS161): Missing.
- Computer Organ & Systems (CS107 or 107E): Missing.
- Principles of Computer Systems (CS110 or CS111): Missing.

#### Significant Implementation Requirement:
- No implementation-designated course such as CS140, CS143, etc., was noted on the transcript.

#### Breadth Requirement:
- No courses recorded to satisfy the breadth requirement from areas A, B, C, or D.

#### AI Depth:
- Required courses such as CS221, CS223A, CS224N, etc., are not found on the transcript.

**Conclusion**: The transcript does not fulfill the MS specialization requirements since pivotal courses in foundations, significant implementation, breadth, and depth are not reflected.

**Output**: 

```
- CS103: Missing
- CS161: Missing
- CS107 or CS107E: Missing
- CS110 or CS111: Missing
- Significant Implementation Course: Missing
- Breadth Requirement Courses: None satisfied
- Depth Requirement Courses: None satisfied
```

**Overall Results**:
- BS Requirements: Not satisfied.
- MS Requirements: Not satisfied.
