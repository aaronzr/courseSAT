        Your task is to generate cvc5 python solver formulas for the constraints in each requirement ELECTIVES:

List here any additional courses used to complete the 45-unit requirement for the MSCS degree. You may count up to a maximum of 3 units of 1-2 unit seminars offered in the School of Engineering. All other electives must be taken for 3 or more units. CS courses numbered above 111, excluding CS196, CS198, and CS390A/B/C, can be used as MS electives. Non-CS courses must be technical courses numbered above 100, related to the degree program, and approved by the adviser and the MS program administrator. Note that CS 129 may not be counted towards the MS if CS 229 is being counted towards any BS or MS requirement.

TOTAL ELECTIVE UNITS APPLIED TO MSCS

TOTAL UNITS APPLIED TO MSCS. You should also include
        solver formulas for advisor approval and deviation constraints if there is one. Please note that your formulas should check taken courses in the transcript against each contraint and requirement. Please generate
        parameterized formulas with respect to the requirements only. 
        =======================formula ouput===========================
Sure! Let's break down each requirement into its respective constraints and then generate corresponding CVC5 SMT solver code.

Firstly, I'll list the requirements we need to encode:
1. The transcript must include additional courses to total 45 units for the MSCS degree.
2. A maximum of 3 units from 1-2 unit seminars.
3. All other electives must be taken for 3 or more units.
4. CS courses numbered above 111, excluding CS196, CS198, and CS390A/B/C, can be used as MS electives.
5. Non-CS courses must be technical courses numbered above 100, related to the degree program, and approved by the adviser and the MS program administrator.
6. CS 129 may not be counted for MS if CS 229 is counted towards any BS or MS requirement.

We'll then formulate these into parameterized CVC5 SMT solver formulas.

```python
from cvc5 import Kind, Solver

# Initialize the solver
solver = Solver()

# Input Variables (simulating part of the given transcript JSON schema)
courses_taken = [
    {"Course_ID": "CS112", "Title": "Course1", "Earned_Units": 3, "Grade": "A"},
    {"Course_ID": "CS113", "Title": "Course2", "Earned_Units": 4, "Grade": "B"},
    # Add more courses as needed
]

# Constraint: Total elective units must be >= 45
units_sum_variable = solver.mkConst(solver.getIntegerSort(), "units_sum")
units_sum_exprs = [solver.mkInteger(course.get("Earned_Units")) for course in courses_taken]
units_sum_constraint = solver.mkTerm(Kind.EQUAL, units_sum_variable, solver.mkTerm(Kind.ADD, *units_sum_exprs))
units_45_constraint = solver.mkTerm(Kind.GEQ, units_sum_variable, solver.mkInteger(45))

# Constraint: Max 3 units from 1-2 unit seminars
seminar_units_variable = solver.mkConst(solver.getIntegerSort(), "seminar_units")
seminar_units_exprs = [solver.mkInteger(course.get("Earned_Units")) for course in courses_taken if course.get("Earned_Units") <= 2]
seminar_units_constraint = solver.mkTerm(Kind.EQUAL, seminar_units_variable, solver.mkTerm(Kind.ADD, *seminar_units_exprs) if seminar_units_exprs else solver.mkInteger(0))
max_seminar_units_constraint = solver.mkTerm(Kind.LEQ, seminar_units_variable, solver.mkInteger(3))

# Constraint: All other electives must be >= 3 units
elective_units_constraints = [solver.mkTerm(Kind.GEQ, solver.mkInteger(course.get("Earned_Units")), solver.mkInteger(3)) for course in courses_taken if course.get("Earned_Units") > 2]

# Constraint: Valid CS courses excluding the specified exclusions
cs_courses_constraints = []
for course in courses_taken:
    course_num = int(course.get("Course_ID")[2:])  # Extract the number part (assuming "CSxxx")
    if course.get("Course_ID").startswith("CS") and course_num > 111:
        if course_num not in {196, 198, 390} and not (390 < course_num < 400):
            cs_courses_constraints.append(solver.mkTrue())
        else:
            cs_courses_constraints.append(solver.mkFalse())
    else:
        cs_courses_constraints.append(solver.mkTrue()) # Non-CS courses will be handled separately

# Constraint: Non-CS courses approval
non_cs_courses_constraints = []
for course in courses_taken:
    if not course.get("Course_ID").startswith("CS") and int(course.get("Course_ID")[2:]) > 100:
        # Assuming these are advisor approved based on the provided transcript
        non_cs_courses_constraints.append(solver.mkTrue())

# Constraint: CS 129 and CS 229 cannot both be counted
cs129_included = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), "cs129_included")
cs229_included = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), "cs229_included")
cs129_constraint = solver.mkTerm(Kind.OR, *[solver.mkTerm(Kind.EQUAL, solver.mkString(course.get("Course_ID")), solver.mkString("CS129")) for course in courses_taken])
cs229_constraint = solver.mkTerm(Kind.OR, *[solver.mkTerm(Kind.EQUAL, solver.mkString(course.get("Course_ID")), solver.mkString("CS229")) for course in courses_taken])
cs129_229_exclusion_constraint = solver.mkTerm(Kind.NOT, solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, cs129_included, cs229_included))

# Combine all constraints together
final_constraints = [
    units_sum_constraint,
    units_45_constraint,
    seminar_units_constraint,
    max_seminar_units_constraint,
    *elective_units_constraints,
    *cs_courses_constraints,
    *non_cs_courses_constraints,
    cs129_229_exclusion_constraint
]

# Combine all into final formula
formula = solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, *final_constraints)
solver.assertFormula(formula)

# Check for satisfiability
if solver.checkSat().isSat():
    print("The given transcript satisfies all ELECTIVES constraints.")
else:
    print("The given transcript does not satisfy all ELECTIVES constraints.")
```

This example assumes you've rigorously structured the input transcripts and verified calculations. Make modifications as necessary to inject actual values in place of placeholders and use proper logic for variable name extractions and constraint specifications.
