Here's how we can define the SMT formulas to represent the constraints for the BREADTH REQUIREMENT:

We'll need to define constraints that check if three selected courses are from different Breadth areas (A, B, C, or D), each course is taken for at least 3 units, and each course is completed for a letter grade. Additionally, no course can be waived.

We'll use cvc5 SMT solver formulas for this purpose:

1. Define the course sets for each Breadth area.
2. Check if the courses taken are from different areas.
3. Assert that each taken course has at least 3 units.
4. Assert that each taken course is graded with a letter.
5. Ensure no deviations unless they are approved.

Explanation:

1. **Breadth Area Definitions**: Lists all courses under Breadth Areas A, B, C, and D using separate boolean functions for each area.
2. **Letter Grade Check**: `is_letter_grade` function checks if the grade is a valid letter grade.
3. **Course Constraints**: The formula `course_constraints` checks if each course has at least 3 units and a letter grade.
4. **Different Areas Constraint**: The formula `different_areas` ensures that the taken courses are from distinct areas.
5. **Final Formula**: Asserts all constraints, including the negation of deviation approval.

Be sure to populate the courses in `is_in_areaA`, `is_in_areaB`, etc., with the respective lists of courses corresponding to areas A, B, C, and D from your requirement description.

This setup ensures that the three courses selected meet all the given constraints, and the SMT solver will check the satisfiability of these constraints based on the provided transcript data.
