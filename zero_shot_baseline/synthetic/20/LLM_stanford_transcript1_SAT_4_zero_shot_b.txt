To determine if David Smith satisfies the BS and MS degree requirements, we’ll break down our analysis into two parts:

1. **BS Requirements Analysis**
2. **MS Specialization Requirements Analysis**

### BS Requirements Analysis

#### BS Core Requirements
- **Programming Abstractions (CS106B)**: Taken in Autumn 2016-2017
- **Computer Organization and Systems (CS107)**: Taken in Winter 2016-2017
- **Principles of Computer Systems (CS111)**: Taken in Spring 2016-2017
- **Mathematical Foundations of Computing (CS103)**: Taken in Autumn 2016-2017
- **Introduction to Probability for Computer Scientists (CS109)**: Taken in Winter 2016-2017
- **Design and Analysis of Algorithms (CS161)**: Taken in Spring 2016-2017

Required Courses (CS 103, 107, 109, 111, 161) were all taken for 5 units each.

#### Senior Project Requirements
- **Senior Project Course**: Not listed in the provided transcript. Options include:
  - CS194 or CS194W
  - CS210B
  - CS191 or CS191W
  - CS294
  - Senior Honors Thesis
  - There’s no evidence David completed any of these courses.

#### AI Track Requirements
- **Mathematics & Science**
  - **MATH19, 20, 21**: Credited via AP (10 units total), and MATH51 (taken).
  - Two math electives: MATH52 and MATH53 (both taken).
  - **CS103**: Core requirement, already taken.
  - **CS109**: Core requirement, already taken.
  - **Science**: PHYSICS 41 (Mechanics) taken.
  - **PHYSICS43 (Electricity and Magnetism)**: Taken.
  - Science Elective: PHYSICS 45 (taken but may prefer a different elective, needs confirmation).

- **Engineering Fundamentals**
  - **CS106B**: Already counted as core requirement.
  - **ENGR40M (Intro to Making: What is EE?)**: Taken.

- **Core**
  - **CS107, 111, 161**: Already counted as core requirements. 

- **Depth**
  - **CS221 (AI: Principles and Techniques)**: Taken in 2017-2018 Autumn.
  - Track Requirement B1: **CS223A (Robotics)**: Taken in 2017-2018 Autumn.
  - Track Requirement B2: **CS224N (NLP with Deep Learning)**: Taken in 2017-2018 Winter.
  - Track Requirement C: **CS231A (Computer Vision)**: Taken in 2017-2018 Winter.
  - Electives: **CS228 (Machine Learning for Sequential Data)**, CS229 (Machine Learning)**, CS324 (General Game Playing)**: All taken.
  
Each course is confirmed to cover the required categories without repeats.

#### Writing in Major (WiM)
- Not evidenced in transcript specifically.

### BS Requirements Conclusion:
David's transcript shows he satisfies all key subject requirements but lacks evidence of completing a senior project course and the Writing in Major (WiM) requirement. 

**BS Requirements Not Satisfied**:
1. Senior Project (One of CS194, CS194W, CS210B, CS191, CS191W, CS294, or equivalent)
2. Writing in Major (WiM completion not evident)


### MS Specialization Requirements Analysis

#### Foundations Requirement:
- **Logic, Automata & Complexity (CS103)**: Already taken, satisfies requirement.
- **Probability (CS109)**: Already taken, satisfies requirement.
- **Algorithmic Analysis (CS161)**: Already taken, satisfies requirement.
- **Computer Org & Sys (CS107)**: Already taken, satisfies requirement.
- **Principles of Computer Systems (CS110/111)**: CS111 taken, satisfies requirement.

Up to 10 units from these courses can be counted towards MS (not included in the depth calculation).

#### Significant Implementation Requirement:
- Courses like **CS143, CS144, CS145, CS148, CS151, CS190, CS210B, etc.** can count. Since applicable courses from the list he took include **CS221** and **CS210B**. *On the transcript, he hasn't listed any of these as significant implementation counted specifically.*

#### Breadth Requirement:
- Three courses from different areas (A, B, C, D).
  - CS221 and CS231A could be in area C and A/M1 respectively.
  - Needs variation across all areas: another course would have to be chosen from different remaining areas.

#### Artificial Intelligence Depth Requirement:
- **CS221**: Taken (core requirement met).
- Four additional courses from the list:
  - **CS223A, CS224N, CS228, CS229**: Taken.
  - The total units from depth courses: More than 21 units confirmed.

#### Electives:
- Up to 3 units counted of 1 or 2-unit seminars permissible.
- Additional units taken (CS324, CS399, etc.) contribute towards the elective requirement.

### MS Requirements Conclusion:
David meets many requirements but needs a clarity on the Significant Implementation Requirement and a complete breadth requirement.

**MS Requirements Partly Satisfied**:
1. Confirm Significant Implementation Course or additional course fulfilling this.
2. Complete a Breadth course across another non-overlapping area.

### Final Outputs:
**BS SAT**: No. Missing Senior Project and WiM.
**MS SAT**: No. Missing documentation for Significant Implementation, still requires one more breadth course from a unique area not already covered.


For completeness:
1. **Documented Senior Project course and WiM** to fulfil BS.
2. **Significant Implementation Requirement Course** and one unique **Area Breadth Course** to fulfil MS.

These specifics are necessary to validate completion of requirements for both degrees.
