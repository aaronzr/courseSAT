==========================================To determine if the BS and MS degree requirements are satisfied for Emily Ann Berkowitz based on her unofficial transcript, let's break down the requirements step-by-step and analyze her completed coursework.

### BS Degree Requirements Analysis:

**BS Core Requirements:**

1. **Programming Abstractions (CS106B):** Taken (B)
2. **Computer Organization and Systems (CS107E):** Taken (A)
3. **Mathematical Foundations of Computing (CS103):** Not listed (Requirement not satisfied)
4. **Introduction to Probability for Computer Scientists (CS109):** Taken (B+)
5. **Design and Analysis of Algorithms (CS161):** Taken (B+)
6. **Principles of Computer Systems (CS111):** Formerly CS110, taken (A)

**BS Senior Project Requirements:**

1. **CS191W (Independent Project Writing Intensive):** Taken (A)

**BS AI Elective Requirements:**

- **Mathematics: (26 units minimum)**
  - MATH19/20/21: Not listed on the transcript (Requirements not satisfied)
  - CS103: Not listed (Requirement not satisfied)
  - CS109: Taken (B+)
  - Two additional electives listed under Math: Taken CME100, CME102, CME104, all count towards electives.

- **Science: (11 units minimum)**
  - PHYS41: Taken (A)
  - PHYS43: Taken (B+)
  - One additional elective listed under Science: Took additional Physics labs PHYS42, PHYS44

**Technology in Society Requirement:**
- Not explicitly listed in the transcript (Requirement must be verified)

**Engineering Fundamentals:**
1. **CS106B (Programming Abstractions):** Taken (B)
2. **ENGR40 (Introductory Electronics):** Taken (B+)
3. **Another course in Engineering Fundamentals:** EE102A (Taken) meets this requirement.

**Core, Depth, and Senior Project GPA:**
- Minimum GPA required: 2.0
- Actual GPA for Core and Senior Project courses: Satisfies the requirement.

### BS Conclusion:
- **Missing Requirement:** Mathematical Foundations of Computing (CS103) and Technology in Society course.
- **Output:**
  ```plaintext
  BS Requirements not satisfied:
  - CS103 Mathematical Foundations of Computing
  - Technology in Society course
  ```

### MS Degree Requirements Analysis:

**Foundations Requirement:**

- **Logic, Automata & Complexity (CS103):** Not listed (Requirement not satisfied)
- **Probability (CS109):** Taken (B+)
- **Algorithmic Analysis (CS161):** Taken (B+)
- **Computer Organization & Sys (CS107 or 107E):** Taken (A, CS107E)
- **Principles of Computer Systems (CS110 or CS111):** Taken (A, formerly CS110)

**Significant Implementation Requirement:**
- CS 191W Independent Project Writing Intensive meets this requirement.

**Breadth Requirement:**
- 3 courses from different areas as listed:
  - Area A: CS221 taken in AI depth, will consider CS 229 for depth (A)
  - Area B: CS140, 140E, 143, 144, etc., CS107E already taken for different area.
  - Area C: CS229 (taken), CS223A (A-)

**AI Depth Requirement:**
1. **CS 221 (AI: Principles and Techniques):** Taken (A)
2. **Four of: CS223A, CS224N, CS224S, CS224U, etc.:** Taken CS229, CS231N, CS237A, CS224N
3. **Total of at least 21 units from categories (a), (b):** Met

**Electives:**
- Additional courses listed as electives to reach 45 units total:
  - CS229M taken (A), CS233 (A-), CS236 (must check later terms GPA)

**Additional Requirements:**
- At most 10 units of Foundations requirement courses may be counted.
- Maximum of 3 units of 1-2 unit seminars, other electives must be 3 units.
- 45 graduate units required: Meets requirement with electives adding up to necessary units.

### MS Conclusion:
- **Missing Requirement:** Logic, Automata & Complexity (CS103)
- **Output:**
  ```plaintext
  MS Requirements not satisfied:
  - Logic, Automata & Complexity (CS103)
  ```

### Summary Output:
```plaintext
BS Requirements not satisfied:
- CS103 Mathematical Foundations of Computing
- Technology in Society course

MS Requirements not satisfied:
- Logic, Automata & Complexity (CS103)
```
