Let's break down and translate each statement into CVC5 Python formulas and then compile everything into a single code snippet.

We'll use CVC5's Python bindings to model these statements.

First, let's import necessary libraries and initialize the SMT solver:

```python
import cvc5
from cvc5 import Solver

solver = Solver()
solver.setOption("produce-models", "true")
bool_sort = solver.getBooleanSort()
```

Next, we'll define the predicates for various conditions for the entities. Entities involved are: bear, cat, dog, rabbit. And possible predicates are: big, visits, chases, eats, round, nice.

```python
# Define entities
bear = solver.mkConst(bool_sort, "bear")
cat = solver.mkConst(bool_sort, "cat")
dog = solver.mkConst(bool_sort, "dog")
rabbit = solver.mkConst(bool_sort, "rabbit")

# Define predicates
big = solver.mkFunction("big", solver.mkFunctionSort(bool_sort, bool_sort))
visits = solver.mkFunction("visits", solver.mkFunctionSort(bool_sort, solver.mkFunctionSort(bool_sort, bool_sort)))
chases = solver.mkFunction("chases", solver.mkFunctionSort(bool_sort, solver.mkFunctionSort(bool_sort, bool_sort)))
eats = solver.mkFunction("eats", solver.mkFunctionSort(bool_sort, solver.mkFunctionSort(bool_sort, bool_sort)))
round_ = solver.mkFunction("round", solver.mkFunctionSort(bool_sort, bool_sort))
nice = solver.mkFunction("nice", solver.mkFunctionSort(bool_sort, bool_sort))
```

Now, let's translate each statement:

1. If something is big then it does not visit the dog.
```python
x = solver.mkBoundVar(bool_sort)
big_x_implies_not_visits_x_dog = solver.mkForall([x], solver.mkTerm(cvc5.KindImpl.NOT, solver.mkTerm(cvc5.KindImpl.APPLY_UF, visits, x, dog)))
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(cvc5.KindImpl.AND, solver.mkTerm(cvc5.KindImpl.FORALL, [x], solver.mkTerm(cvc5.KindImpl.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(cvc5.KindImpl.APPLY_UF, big, x), big_x_implies_not_visits_x_dog))))
```

2. If something visits the rabbit then it chases the rabbit.
```python
visits_x_rabbit_implies_chases_x_rabbit = solver.mkForall([x], solver.mkTerm(cvc5.KindImpl.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(cvc5.KindImpl.APPLY_UF, visits, x, rabbit), solver.mkTerm(cvc5.KindImpl.APPLY_UF, chases, x, rabbit)))
solver.assertFormula(visits_x_rabbit_implies_chases_x_rabbit)
```

3. If something chases the cat then it is round.
```python
chases_x_cat_implies_round_x = solver.mkForall([x], solver.mkTerm(cvc5.KindImpl.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(cvc5.KindImpl.APPLY_UF, chases, x, cat), solver.mkTerm(cvc5.KindImpl.APPLY_UF, round_, x)))
solver.assertFormula(chases_x_cat_implies_round_x)
```

4. If something visits the cat and it chases the dog then it is round.
```python
visits_x_cat_and_chases_x_dog_implies_round_x = solver.mkForall([x], solver.mkTerm(cvc5.KindImpl.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(cvc5.KindImpl.AND, solver.mkTerm(cvc5.KindImpl.APPLY_UF, visits, x, cat), solver.mkTerm(cvc5.KindImpl.APPLY_UF, chases, x, dog)), solver.mkTerm(cvc5.KindImpl.APPLY_UF, round_, x))
solver.assertFormula(visits_x_cat_and_chases_x_dog_implies_round_x)
```

5. If something eats the cat then it is not big.
```python
eats_x_cat_implies_not_big = solver.mkForall([x], solver.mkTerm(cvc5.KindImpl.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(cvc5.KindImpl.APPLY_UF, eats, x, cat), solver.mkTerm(cvc5.KindImpl.NOT, solver.mkTerm(cvc5.KindImpl.APPLY_UF, big, x))))
solver.assertFormula(eats_x_cat_implies_not_big)
```

6. Round things are big.
```python
round_x_implies_big = solver.mkForall([x], solver.mkTerm(cvc5.KindImpl.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(cvc5.KindImpl.APPLY_UF, round_, x), solver.mkTerm(cvc5.KindImpl.APPLY_UF, big, x)))
solver.assertFormula(round_x_implies_big)
```

7. If something chases the rabbit then the rabbit chases the cat.
```python
chases_x_rabbit_implies_rabbit_chases_cat = solver.mkForall([x], solver.mkTerm(cvc5.KindImpl.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(cvc5.KindImpl.APPLY_UF, chases, x, rabbit), solver.mkTerm(cvc5.KindImpl.APPLY_UF, chases, rabbit, cat)))
solver.assertFormula(chases_x_rabbit_implies_rabbit_chases_cat)
```

8. The bear is round.
```python
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(cvc5.KindImpl.APPLY_UF, round_, bear))
```

9. The bear visits the rabbit.
```python
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(cvc5.KindImpl.APPLY_UF, visits, bear, rabbit))
```

10. The cat eats the dog.
```python
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(cvc5.KindImpl.APPLY_UF, eats, cat, dog))
```

11. The cat visits the bear.
```python
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(cvc5.KindImpl.APPLY_UF, visits, cat, bear))
```

12. The dog does not eat the cat.
```python
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(cvc5.KindImpl.NOT, solver.mkTerm(cvc5.KindImpl.APPLY_UF, eats, dog, cat)))
```

13. The dog is not nice.
```python
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(cvc5.KindImpl.NOT, solver.mkTerm(cvc5.KindImpl.APPLY_UF, nice, dog)))
```

14. The dog is round.
```python
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(cvc5.KindImpl.APPLY_UF, round_, dog))
```

15. The dog visits the bear.
```python
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(cvc5.KindImpl.APPLY_UF, visits, dog, bear))
```

16. The rabbit chases the dog.
```python
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(cvc5.KindImpl.APPLY_UF, chases, rabbit, dog))
```

17. The rabbit eats the bear.
```python
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(cvc5.KindImpl.APPLY_UF, eats, rabbit, bear))
```

Finally, the test statement: The rabbit is round.
```python
test_formula = solver.mkTerm(cvc5.KindImpl.APPLY_UF, round_, rabbit)
solver.assertFormula(test_formula)
```

Putting it all together:

```python

solver.assertFormula(test_formula)

# Check satisfiability
result = solver.checkSat()
print("Result of the test statement:", result)
```
