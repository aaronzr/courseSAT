Sure, I'll break down the SMT formulas and translate them into a natural language description:

1. **Initial Setup**:
   Each course category has a variable name (`course_a`, `course_b`, `course_c`, `course_d`, `course_e`) and the units for that course category (`course_a_units`, `course_b_units`, `course_c_units`, `course_d_units`, `course_e_units`).

2. **Given Units Condition**:
   - `course_e_units` is set to 5.
   - `course_d_units` is set to 5.
   - `course_c_units` is set to 5.
   - `course_b_units` is set to 5.
   - `course_a_units` is set to 5.

3. **Course-specific Condition**:
   For `course_a`, `course_b`, `course_c`, `course_d`, and `course_e`:
   - If a course is "CME 106", then it must have exactly 4 units.
   - If the course is "CME 100", "CME 102", "CME 104", or "CS 106B", it must have exactly 5 units.

4. **Specific Course Listing**:
   - If a course aligns with any expected value for `course_a`, then it should match this common set: "CS 103", "CS109", "Stat116", "CME106", "MS&E220", "EE178", "CS161", "CS107", "CS107E", "CS110", or "CS111".

5. **Total Units Condition**:
   The total units across all five course categories shouldn’t exceed 10 units.

6. **Consistency Across Courses**:
   - Ensure the course labels maintain certain string equivalency e.g., "None" equals "CS 103", "CS 103" equals "CS109", and so on until "CS110" equals "CS111". This is logically ensuring that no two different courses hold this label except in a hypothetical check for every possible substitution.

### Translation to Natural Language:

- Course `course_a` in "Logic, Automata & Complexity" category, course `course_b` in "Probability" category, course `course_c` in "Algorithmic Analysis" category, course `course_d` in "Computer Organ & Sys" category, and course `course_e` in "Principles of Computer Systems" category each must have exactly 5 units, unless the course code is "CME 106", in which case it should have 4 units.
- The total number of units from these five courses should not exceed 10 units.
- `course_a`, `course_b`, `course_c`, `course_d`, `course_e` should belong to a predefined set of courses including "CS 103", "CS109", "Stat116", "CME106", "MS&E220", "EE178", "CS161", "CS107", "CS107E", "CS110", or "CS111".
- Finally, courses should be equated in sequence ensuring logical consistency of named equivalency chains for different foundational categories reflecting either same or a consistent possibility range, although this part seems more theoretical consistency enforced in terms of each individual check.

Summarized, it asserts that you need exactly 5-unit courses (unless specified differently for CME 106) from each foundational category, ensuring total units from all such required foundational courses don’t exceed 10 units, and these courses must align with a specified course list while maintaining relatable consistency across categories.
