        Your task is to generate cvc5 python solver formulas for the constraints in each requirement SIGNIFICANT IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENT: At least one course in your MS program should be designated as satisfying the Significant Implementation Requirement. Note that this course will also be used to satisfy some other requirement (i.e., Depth, or Elective). Must be taken for a letter grade, must be taken at Stanford. Coterm students who took two of these courses at Stanford as undergraduates may waive this requirement. Deviations must be approved by the faculty director of the MS program, Cynthia Lee.

Course Number: Title: Grade

Courses that may be used to satisfy the significant implementation requirement include: CS 140, 140E, 143, 144, 145, 148, 151, 190, 210B, 212, 221, 227B, 231N, 243, 248/248A, and 341. you have identified.
        Your formulas should include every constrint, including the ones related to advisor approval and deviations.

        When generating parameterized cvc5 solver formulas, please instantiate new variables to check the transcript schema against each constraint in the SIGNIFICANT IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENT: At least one course in your MS program should be designated as satisfying the Significant Implementation Requirement. Note that this course will also be used to satisfy some other requirement (i.e., Depth, or Elective). Must be taken for a letter grade, must be taken at Stanford.

        solver formulas for advisor approval and deviation constraints if there is one. Please note that your formulas should check taken courses in the transcript against each contraint and requirement. Please generate

Certainly! Let's generate the CVC5 solver formulas considering all the constraints for the "SIGNIFICANT IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENT". We will proceed step by step based on the provided requirements.

Here are the steps we'll follow:
1. **Checking if a course satisfies the significant implementation requirement.**
2. **Ensuring the course is taken for a letter grade.**
3. **Ensuring the course is taken at Stanford.**
4. **Handling cases where coterm students took equivalent courses as undergraduates.**
5. **Checking for approved deviations.**
6. **Ensuring advisor approval for deviations.**

In this code, we create the CVC5 constraints according to the significant implementation requirement and apply them to the given transcript schema. We ensure the course is part of the significant implementation list, is taken for a letter grade, is taken at Stanford, or is validated through approved deviations.
