        When generating cvc5 solver formulas, please instantiate new variables to check the transcript schema against each constraint in the ARTIFICIAL INTELLEGIENCE DEPTH. You should also include
        solver formulas for advisor approval and deviation constraints if there is one. Please generate
        formulas with respect to the requirements only. 
        =======================formula ouput===========================
Sure, let's define the constraints based on the requirements for the ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE DEPTH in a structured manner using cvc5 solver formulas. 

### Overview of Requirements
1. All depth courses must be taken for a letter grade for 3 or more units.
2. A maximum of 6 units of CS 399 Independent Study may be counted towards the depth.
3. Any deviations must be noted and approved (maximum of one adviser-approved deviation allowed).
4. Courses taken for your Stanford undergraduate degree do not need to be repeated.
5. Specific courses in categories (a), (b), and (c) must be fulfilled.
6. A total of at least 21 units from categories (a), (b), and (c).

### cvc5 Solver Variables
We'll create solver variables to instantiate constraints based on the `transcript` schema.

```python
from cvc5 import Solver, Kind, Term

solver = Solver()
solver.setOption("produce-models", "true")

# 1. All depth courses must be taken for a letter grade* for 3 or more units
depth_courses = [solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, 
                  solver.mkTerm(Kind.GEQ, solver.mkString(course.get("Earned_Units")), solver.mkInteger(3)),
                  solver.mkTerm(Kind.OR, 
                      solver.mkTerm(Kind.EQUAL, solver.mkString(course.get("Grade")), solver.mkString('A')),
                      solver.mkTerm(Kind.EQUAL, solver.mkString(course.get("Grade")), solver.mkString('B')),

### Instructions to Run
- Ensure you have cvc5 installed.
- Define the `transcript` variable as per the template and execute the code above.
- The script will check whether the transcript meets the requirements and print the result accordingly.

This overall approach ensures each constraint, including the advisor-approved deviations, is verified in cvc5 based on the specified schema.
