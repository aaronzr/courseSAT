course_units = Based on the provided document, the courses related to the Technology in Society Requirement (TiS) that also meet the Writing in the Major (WiM) requirement are "CS181W" and "CS182W". However, you asked specifically for the course units to be extracted. Given that the exact units for these courses are not provided in your document, I can only output the placeholder in the same format you showed in the example.
