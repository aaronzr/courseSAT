==========================================### BS Degree Analysis:

To determine if Amanda Johnson has satisfied the BS degree requirements based on her transcript, we need to check each specified requirement. Below is the analysis per requirement:

#### Core Requirements
- **CS106B (Programming Abstractions)**: Completed with a grade of C.
- **CS107 (Computer Organization and Systems)**: Completed with a grade of C.
- **CS111 (Principles of Computer Systems)**: Not explicitly mentioned but presumably needed if counted from CS110.
- **CS103 (Mathematical Foundations of Computing)**: Completed with a B+.
- **CS109 (Introduction to Probability for Computer Scientists)**: Completed with a B+.
- **CS161 (Data Structures and Algorithms)**: Completed with a grade of D, which likely does not meet the requirement of minimum C grade.

#### Senior Project Requirements
Amanda's transcript does not specify a standard Senior Project course like CS194, CS194W, CS210B, CS191, or CS191W, which are typical for fulfilling Senior Project requirements.

#### AI Elective Requirements:
- **AI Track Core, Depth, and Senior Project (43 units minimum)**
  - **Core (15 units minimum)**:
    - CS107: Completed with C
    - CS111: Not explicitly satisfied
    - CS161: Not satisfied due to low grade.
  - **Track Requirement A (CS221: AI: Principles and Techniques)**: Not found in transcript.
  - **Track Requirement B**:
    - Robotics (CS223A): Completed with a B
    - Natural Language Processing (CS224 series): CS222 completed with a B
  - **Track Requirement C**: Not specified in the transcript.
  - **Elective Courses**: Multiple unspecified potential electives could align, including CS248 and CS270.
  - **Senior Project**: No standard course mentioned.

### Conclusion for BS Degree:
**Not Satisfied**. Specifically:
1. **CS161** grade is too low (D).
2. **Senior Project** course requirement is not satisfied.

### MS Specialization Analysis:
For the MS specialization in Artificial Intelligence, we analyze based on the provided requirements:

#### Foundations Requirement:
All necessary foundation courses have acceptable undergraduate grade sources:

- **CS103**: Completed with B+
- **CS109**: Completed with B+
- **CS161**: Completed with D (possible issue here for minimum grade requirement; generally, a grade of D is unacceptable).
- **CS107**: Completed with C
- **CS111**: Completed through equivalent or higher-level courses.

#### Significant Implementation Requirement:
Course Number: Not explicitly satisfied. No course specifically noted as fulfilling the requirement.

#### Breadth Requirement:
Three courses, each from a different Breadth area:
- Area A, B, C, or D: Not clear if specifically chosen correctly without more context.

#### AI Depth:
- CS 221: Not found.
- Four deep courses: 
  - CS 223A (Robotics) with a B
  - CS222 (Natural Language Processing) with a B
  - CS270 (Computational Biology) with an A.

#### Total graduate units:
Needs at least 45 graduate units, but a match of total units is hard to ascertain from the partially detailed records.

### Conclusion for MS Degree:
**Not Satisfied**. Specifically:
1. **Foundations Requirement**: CS161 grade is too low.
2. **Significant Implementation Requirement**: Not fulfilled.
3. **Total graduate units** not explicitly confirmed as passing 45 units.

---

**Summary Output:**
**BS UNSATISFIED**:
- CS161: Data Structures & Algorithms (grade D unsatisfactory)
- Senior Project Requirement not cleared.

**MS UNSATISFIED**:
- Foundations Requirement: CS161 grade (D)
- Significant Implementation Not indicated
- Breadth Requirement: Need a clear 3 different breadth areas courses.
- Depth Requirement: Missing CS 221 and completion of total appropriate units.

**Recommendations**:
- Amanda should address her CS161 grade issue via a retake or alternative means per department advisement.
- Clear completion and coordinating senior project through a specialized course.
- Verify specific depth and breadth courses' proper registration and completion for MS degree alongside taking the indicated required or equivalent significant implementation course.
