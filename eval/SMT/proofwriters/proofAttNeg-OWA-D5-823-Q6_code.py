Sure! To convert the provided natural language statements into parameterized CVC5 Python formulas, we'll first define the necessary boolean variables and then translate each statement into SMT formulas. Finally, we'll evaluate the test statement.

Let's start by importing the CVC5 library and defining the necessary Solver and variables.

```python
import cvc5
from cvc5 import Kind

solver = cvc5.Solver()

# Define each individual as a boolean variable
big = dict()
blue = dict()
rough = dict()
young = dict()
cold = dict()
green = dict()
round = dict()

names = ["Harry", "Charlie", "Erin", "Fiona"]
for name in names:
    big[name] = solver.mkBool(name + "_big")
    blue[name] = solver.mkBool(name + "_blue")
    rough[name] = solver.mkBool(name + "_rough")
    young[name] = solver.mkBool(name + "_young")
    cold[name] = solver.mkBool(name + "_cold")
    green[name] = solver.mkBool(name + "_green")
    round[name] = solver.mkBool(name + "_round")

# Additional variable for general "something"
big['something'] = solver.mkBool("something_big")
blue['something'] = solver.mkBool("something_blue")
rough['something'] = solver.mkBool("something_rough")
young['something'] = solver.mkBool("something_young")
cold['something'] = solver.mkBool("something_cold")
green['something'] = solver.mkBool("something_green")
round['something'] = solver.mkBool("something_round")

# Now, let's translate the sentences

# 1. If something is big then it is rough
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, big['something'], rough['something']))

# 2. All blue, big things are rough
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, blue['something'], big['something']), rough['something']))

# 3. Blue, young things are rough
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, blue['something'], young['something']), rough['something']))

# 4. Cold, rough things are green
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, cold['something'], rough['something']), green['something']))

# 5. If something is young and blue then it is cold
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, young['something'], blue['something']), cold['something']))

# 6. All cold, green things are young
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, cold['something'], green['something']), young['something']))

# 7. All young, round things are not blue
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, young['something'], round['something']), solver.mkTerm(Kind.NOT, blue['something'])))

# 8. Young things are round
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, young['something'], round['something']))

# 9. If Harry is cold then Harry is big
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, cold['Harry'], big['Harry']))

# 10. Charlie is cold
solver.assertFormula(cold['Charlie'])

# 11. Erin is big
solver.assertFormula(big['Erin'])

# 12. Erin is not blue
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(Kind.NOT, blue['Erin']))

# 13. Erin is green
solver.assertFormula(green['Erin'])

# 14. Erin is round
solver.assertFormula(round['Erin'])

# 15. Erin is young
solver.assertFormula(young['Erin'])

# 16. Fiona is big
solver.assertFormula(big['Fiona'])

# 17. Fiona is not blue
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(Kind.NOT, blue['Fiona']))

# 18. Fiona is cold
solver.assertFormula(cold['Fiona'])

# 19. Fiona is green
solver.assertFormula(green['Fiona'])

# 20. Fiona is rough
solver.assertFormula(rough['Fiona'])

# 21. Fiona is round
solver.assertFormula(round['Fiona'])

# 22. Fiona is young
solver.assertFormula(young['Fiona'])

# 23. Harry is cold
solver.assertFormula(cold['Harry'])

# Test statement: Harry is not rough
test_statement = solver.mkTerm(Kind.NOT, rough['Harry'])

# Add the test statement to the solver and check satisfiability
solver.assertFormula(test_statement)
result = solver.checkSat()

# Print the result
print(result.isSat())
```

In this script:
1. We declared boolean variables for each attribute (big, blue, rough, etc.) for each individual (Harry, Charlie, Erin, Fiona) and a generic "something".
2. We converted each contextual statement to an SMT formula and asserted it.
3. We added the test statement (`Harry is not rough.`) and checked for satisfiability.

Run this script in your Python environment with CVC5 installed to see if the test statement holds. The output will indicate `True` or `False` based on SMT solver's evaluation of the test statement.
