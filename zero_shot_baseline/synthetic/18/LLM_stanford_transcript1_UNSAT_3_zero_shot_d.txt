```========================GPT Answer to Prompt Two Regarding MS Requirements====================
Based on the given transcript and the MS requirements, let's evaluate each specific requirement:

### Foundations Requirement:
- **CS 103 (Logic, Automata & Complexity)**: No equivalent found in the transcript.
- **Probability (CS109, Stat116, CME106, MS&E220, or EE178)**: **CS 109 INTRO TO PROBABILITY (B)**
- **Algorithmic Analysis (CS161)**: No equivalent found in the transcript.
- **Computer Organ & Sys (CS107 or 107E)**: **CS 107E COMPUTER SYSTEMS (B+)**
- **Principles of Computer Systems (CS110 or CS111)**: No equivalent found in the transcript.

*Total Units used to satisfy the Foundations Requirement*: Only CS 109 and CS 107E are satisfied.
