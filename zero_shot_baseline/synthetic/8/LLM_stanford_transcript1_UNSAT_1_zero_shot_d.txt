```========================GPT Answer to Prompt Two Regarding MS Requirements====================
To determine whether Samantha Marie Franklin's transcript satisfies the MSCS degree requirements for the Artificial Intelligence specialization, let's analyze the provided transcript along with the MS requirements:

### FOUNDATIONS REQUIREMENT
1. **Logic, Automata & Complexity (CS103)** - Not found in transcript.
2. **Probability (CS109, Stat116, CME106, MS&E220, or EE178)** - Not found in transcript.
3. **Algorithmic Analysis (CS161)** - CS 201 ALGORITHMS was completed with A-.
4. **Computer Organ & Sys (CS107 or 107E)** - Not found in transcript.
5. **Principles of Computer Systems (CS110 or CS111)** - Not found in transcript.

### SIGNIFICANT IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENT
- Must be taken at Stanford and must be one of the specified courses.
- CS 402 ROBOTICS is a possible course if it satisfies implementation, but confirmation needed.

### BREADTH REQUIREMENT
Three courses, one from each different Breadth area (A, B, C, or D), each for at least 3 units, letter grade only:

1. **Area A (Mathematical and Theoretical Foundations)** - None found in the transcript.
2. **Area B (Computer Systems)** - Possible relevant course: CS 202 OPERATING SYSTEMS completed with a B-. Requires confirmation if it counts.
3. **Area C (Applications)** - CS 403 DEEP LEARNING completed with B+.
4. **Area D (Computing and Society)** - None found in the transcript.

### ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE DEPTH REQUIREMENT
a) **CS 221** - Not found in the transcript.
b) **Four of the following**:
   - CS 223A, 224N, 224S, 224U, 224V, 224W, 228, 229, 231A, 231N, 234, 237A, 237B, 238 
     - Completed: CS 306 Artificial Intelligence - does not fully match
     - Completed: CS 307 Natural Language Processing B+
     - CS 401 Advanced Machine Learning B-. (Questionable if this counts as these are higher level courses)
c) **A total of at least 21 units from the Depth courses including a) and b)** - Total not satisfied based on available courses.

### ELECTIVES
To complete the 45-unit requirement. Conflicting information on outstanding units, should confirm actual graduate course units.

### ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS
- **At most 10 units of Foundations courses counted toward the 45 units.** - Unclear due to missing foundation courses.
- **At least 36 units must be taken for a letter grade** - Letter grade related analysis needed.
- **3.0 GPA minimum** - Current GPA needs to be checked if accurate for MS courses as courses not finalized for analysis.

**Summary**:
- **Foundations Requirement**: Not fully satisfied. CS103, CS109 (Probability), CS107, CS110 missing.
- **Breadth Requirement**: Partially satisfied. Confirm Area A and D.
- **AI Depth Requirement**: Not fully satisfied. Missing CS 221.
- **Electives**: Analysis incomplete due to tracking graduate course completions.

### Decision:
**MS NOT SAT**
Courses not satisfied:
- Foundation: CS 103, CS109 (or equivalents), CS 107 (or equivalents), CS 110 (or equivalents).
- Breadth: Area A (at least 1), Area D.
- AI Depth Requirement: CS 221 + Total unit count from Depth courses
- Significant Implementation requirement: Confirmation required on course meeting criteria.

Further input from advisor on specific graduate elements and foundation substitutes is mandatory.
