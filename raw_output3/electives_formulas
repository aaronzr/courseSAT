        Your task is to generate cvc5 python solver formulas for the constraints in each requirement ELECTIVES:

List here any additional courses used to complete the 45-unit requirement for the MSCS degree. You may count up to a maximum of 3 units of 1-2 unit seminars offered in the School of Engineering. All other electives must be taken for 3 or more units. CS courses numbered above 111, excluding CS196, CS198, and CS390A/B/C, can be used as MS electives. Non-CS courses must be technical courses numbered above 100, related to the degree program, and approved by the adviser and the MS program administrator. Note that CS 129 may not be counted towards the MS if CS 229 is being counted towards any BS or MS requirement.

        =======================formula ouput===========================
Sure, here are the cvc5 SMT solver formulas to check the transcript schema against each constraint specified in the requirements for ELECTIVES and additional requirements for the MSCS degree. These formulas will validate the constraints when given a schema in the provided JSON format. We'll be using the cvc5 Python API to build these formulas.

First, I'll create a Python function that sets up the cvc5 solver and establishes the constraints:

```python

    solver.setOption("incremental", "true")

This script sets up the cvc5 environment and evaluates each requirement for the MSCS program. Each constraint has been broken down and converted into terms understood by the solver to check the satisfiability of a given student's transcript against the program's requirements. Adjust the logic and variable names as needed to fit precisely into your dataset structure and requirements.
