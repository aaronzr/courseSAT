First, let's import CVC5 and set up the necessary environment:
```python
import cvc5
from cvc5 import Kind

# Create a solver instance
solver = cvc5.Solver()

# Set the logic
solver.setLogic("QF_UF")  # Quantifier-free uninterpreted functions

# Rollback scope settings
solver.push()

# Define sorts
Thing = solver.getBooleanSort()

# Define functions
big = solver.mkFunction("big", Thing, solver.getBooleanSort())
quiet = solver.mkFunction("quiet", Thing, solver.getBooleanSort())
green = solver.mkFunction("green", Thing, solver.getBooleanSort())
round = solver.mkFunction("round", Thing, solver.getBooleanSort())
nice = solver.mkFunction("nice", Thing, solver.getBooleanSort())
young = solver.mkFunction("young", Thing, solver.getBooleanSort())
rough = solver.mkFunction("rough", Thing, solver.getBooleanSort())

# Define constants
Bob = solver.mkConst(Thing, "Bob")
Charlie = solver.mkConst(Thing, "Charlie")
Erin = solver.mkConst(Thing, "Erin")
Gary = solver.mkConst(Thing, "Gary")

# Big, quiet things are green.
solver.assertFormula(
    solver.mkForall([solver.mkVar(Thing, "x")],
                    solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES,
                                  solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND,
                                                solver.mkTerm(big, solver.mkVar(Thing, "x")),
                                                solver.mkTerm(quiet, solver.mkVar(Thing, "x"))),
                                  solver.mkTerm(green, solver.mkVar(Thing, "x")))))

# If Bob is round then Bob is nice.
solver.assertFormula(
    solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES,
                  solver.mkTerm(round, Bob),
                  solver.mkTerm(nice, Bob)))

# If something is young then it is round.
solver.assertFormula(
    solver.mkForall([solver.mkVar(Thing, "x")],

                                  solver.mkTerm(round, solver.mkVar(Thing, "x")))))

# All quiet things are nice.
solver.assertFormula(
    solver.mkForall([solver.mkVar(Thing, "x")],
                    solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES,
                                  solver.mkTerm(quiet, solver.mkVar(Thing, "x")),
                                  solver.mkTerm(nice, solver.mkVar(Thing, "x")))))

# All nice things are young.
solver.assertFormula(
    solver.mkForall([solver.mkVar(Thing, "x")],
                    solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES,
                                  solver.mkTerm(nice, solver.mkVar(Thing, "x")),
                                  solver.mkTerm(young, solver.mkVar(Thing, "x")))))

# Quiet, round things are big.
solver.assertFormula(
    solver.mkForall([solver.mkVar(Thing, "x")],
                    solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES,
                                  solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND,
                                                solver.mkTerm(quiet, solver.mkVar(Thing, "x")),
                                                solver.mkTerm(round, solver.mkVar(Thing, "x"))),
                                  solver.mkTerm(big, solver.mkVar(Thing, "x")))))

# Bob is big.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(big, Bob))

# Bob is quiet.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(quiet, Bob))

# Bob is young.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(young, Bob))

# Charlie is young.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(young, Charlie))

# Erin is quiet.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(quiet, Erin))

# Erin is rough.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(rough, Erin))

# Gary is green.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(green, Gary))

# Gary is nice.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(nice, Gary))

# Gary is quiet.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(quiet, Gary))

# Gary is rough.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(rough, Gary))

# Gary is young.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(young, Gary))

# Test statement: Gary is not big.
test_statement = solver.mkTerm(Kind.NOT, solver.mkTerm(big, Gary))

# Check if the test statement is satisfied
solver.assertFormula(test_statement)
result = solver.checkSat()

# Print the result
print(result)
```

This setup represents the contextual statements using the CVC5 SMT solver. The provided test statement (`Gary is not big.`) is then asserted and checked for satisfiability. The `result` will indicate whether the test statement is satisfiable (`cvc5.Result.SAT`), unsatisfiable (`cvc5.Result.UNSAT`), or unknown (`cvc5.Result.UNKNOWN`). Running this script will leverage the SMT solver to evaluate the statement according to the given constraints.
