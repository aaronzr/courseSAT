**END OF TRANSCRIPT.**  
==========================================Based on the provided information, let's first determine if Samantha Mae Fisher satisfies all the requirements for her Bachelor of Science (BS) degree in Computer Science (CS) with an Artificial Intelligence (AI) track. Then, we will assess if she satisfies the Master of Science (MS) degree in Computer Science artificial intelligence specialization requirements.

### Bachelor of Science (BS) Requirements Analysis

#### Core Requirements (must have a minimum 2.0 GPA for all courses):

- **CS107**: Computer Organization and Systems - CS 107, earned A- (satisfied)
- **CS111**: Operating Systems Principles - CS 111, earned B+ (satisfied)
- **CS161**: Design and Analysis of Algorithms - CS 161, earned B+ (satisfied)

#### Depth Requirements (total of at least 25 units and seven courses minimum):

- **CS221**: AI: Principles and Techniques - CS 221, earned A- (satisfied)
- **Track Requirement B**:
  - AI Methods: CS 229, earned B+ (satisfied)
  - Natural Language Processing: CS 224N, earned A (satisfied)
- **Track Requirement C**:
  - Additional courses: CS 224U, earned A (satisfied)
  - Courses counting towards the 25-unit total:
    - CS 224N (Artificial Intelligence Depth requirement b)
    - CS 224U (Artificial Intelligence Depth requirement b)
    - CS 229 (Artificial Intelligence Depth requirement b)
    - CS 231A (Artificial Intelligence Depth requirement b), earned B+
    - CS 238, earned A-
    - CS 234, earned A

#### Electives (totaling at least 43 units min from core, depth, and senior project):

- **Electives used**:
  - CS 238, earned A-
  - CS 234, earned A

#### Senior Project:
- **CS194**: Software Project Experience - CS 194, earned A- (satisfied)
- Senior Project course is also WiM requirement (Writing in the Major).

#### Math and Science Requirements:

- **Mathematics** (totaling 26 units minimum):
  - MATH 19: Calculus, earned A (5 units)
  - MATH 20: Calculus, earned A- (5 units)
  - MATH 21: Calculus, earned B+ (5 units)
  - CS 103: Mathematical Foundations of Computing, earned B (5 units)
  - CS 109: Introduction to Probability for Computer Scientists, earned A (5 units)
- **Science** (totaling 11 units minimum):
  - PHYS 41: Mechanics, earned A (4 units)
  - PHYS 43: Electricity and Magnetism, earned B (4 units)
  - PHYS 21: Physics Lab, earned S (3 units)

Total Math Units: 25 + 1 unit (additional from AP credits toward Math requirement)
Total Science Units: 11 units satisfied.

#### Engineering Fundamentals (minimum 10 units):

- **CS 106B**: Programming Abstractions, earned B+ (5 units)
- **ENGR 40M**: An Intro to Making, earned B+ (4 units)
 
Engineering Fundamentals Total: 9 units (CS106A not needed).

### Summary:
Samantha Mae Fisher satisfies all the BS requirements:

Output: **BS SAT**.

### Master of Science (MS) Requirements Analysis

#### Foundations Requirement (maximum 10 units counted):
- **Logic, Automata & Complexity**: CS103, earned B (formerly satisfied as undergrad, not counted)
- **Probability**: CS109, earned A (formerly satisfied as undergrad, not counted)
- **Algorithmic Analysis**: CS161, earned B+ (formerly satisfied as undergrad, not counted)
- **Computer Org & Sys**: CS107, earned A- (formerly satisfied as undergrad, not counted)
- **Principles of Computer Systems**: CS111, earned B+ (formerly satisfied as undergrad, not counted)
  
No additional units counted for Foundations Requirement.

#### Significant Implementation Requirement (included in Breadth/Depth/Elective):
- **CS194**: Software Project Experience, earned A- (10 units)
- Other Breadth courses completed within MS:

#### Breadth Requirement (each course chosen from a different Breadth area):
- **Area A**: Mathematical and Theoretical Foundations - CS 103, earned B (formerly satisfied)
- **Area B**: Computer Systems - CS 107, earned A- (formerly satisfied)
- **Area C**: Applications - CS 221/ 224N/ 224U/ 234/ 238, already qualified in CS221 earned A- (formerly satisfied)
- **Area D**: Computing and Society - CS Not satisfied (needs courses from the list)

#### Depth (21 units minimum):
- 21 units from AI depth courses:
  - CS 224N, earned A (3 units)
  - CS 224U, earned A (3 units)
  - CS 231A, earned B+ (3 units)
  - CS 238, earned A- (3 units)
  - CS 234, earned A (3 units)
  - More to be added

#### Electives (remaining with units to complete 45 MS units):
- Any additional courses not counting previously applied, at least 100 level, technical

#### General Additional Requirements:
- 45 graduate units at Stanford degree (should total up).
- At least 36 units must be letter-graded
- Average GPA at least 3.0 in submitted courses.

**Courses not satisfied:**
- Area D: Computing and Society needs valid course from list.
- Check Electives for valid units, preferably those missing from accumulation if total does not complete 45 units for MS.

Output: **List MS courses not satisfied:**
1. At least three Breadth Area D: Computing and Society
2. Assure adherence to requirements for 45 total units with significant course.

**Trace through relevant courses, advise homework done for corrections or advisory meeting.**
