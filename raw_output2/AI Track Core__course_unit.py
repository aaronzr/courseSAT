course_units = Certainly! Here is the list of course units converted into a Python list format. I've assumed placeholders for each course unit:

```python
[
    cs107_units, cs107e_units, cs111_units, cs161_units, cs221_units,
    cs224r_units, cs228_units, cs229_units, cs229m_units, cs229t_units, cs234_units, cs238_units,
    cs124_units, cs224n_units, cs224s_units, cs224u_units, cs224v_units,
    cs131_units, cs231a_units, cs231n_units,
    cs123_units, cs223a_units, cs237a_units,
    cs157_units, cs205l_units, cs230_units, cs236_units, cs257_units, stats315a_units, stats315b_units,
    cs235_units, cs279_units, cs371_units,
    cs224w_units, cs276_units,
    cs256_units,
    cs151_units, cs227b_units,
    cs225a_units, cs327a_units, cs329_units, engr205_units, msande251_units, msande351_units,
    cs325b_units, cs326_units, cs329d_units, cs330_units, cs338_units, cs428_units,
    ee263_units, ee278_units, ee364a_units, ee364b_units,
    msande252_units, msande352_units, msande355_units,
    phil152_units,
    psych204a_units, psych204b_units, psych209_units,
    stats200_units, stats202_units, stats203_units, stats205_units, stats271_units,
    cs191_units, cs191w_units, cs194_units, cs194h_units, cs194w_units, cs210b_units, cs294_units
]
```

This list contains a placeholder for each unit count associated with the courses listed. Each `*_units` should be replaced with the actual number of units for the respective course. For example, `cs107_units` should be replaced with the actual units for CS107.
