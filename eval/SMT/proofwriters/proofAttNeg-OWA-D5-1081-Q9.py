Below, I will translate each of the given statements into CVC5 Python formulas, and then we will construct a test case to evaluate the test statement.

First, let's set up our CVC5 SMT environment:

```python
import cvc5
from cvc5 import Kind

# Create an SMT solver instance
solver = cvc5.Solver()

# Define Boolean variables
Fiona_cold = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), "Fiona_cold")
Fiona_young = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), "Fiona_young")
Fiona_quiet = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), "Fiona_quiet")
Fiona_kind = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), "Fiona_kind")

Dave_smart = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), "Dave_smart")
Dave_cold = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), "Dave_cold")
Dave_kind = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), "Dave_kind")
Dave_young = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), "Dave_young")

Charlie_cold = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), "Charlie_cold")
Charlie_quiet = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), "Charlie_quiet")

Harry_young = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), "Harry_young")
Harry_kind = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), "Harry_kind")

# Define functions for properties
smart = solver.mkConst(solver.mkFunctionSort(solver.getBooleanSort()), "smart")
kind = solver.mkConst(solver.mkFunctionSort(solver.getBooleanSort()), "kind")
young = solver.mkConst(solver.mkFunctionSort(solver.getBooleanSort()), "young")
cold = solver.mkConst(solver.mkFunctionSort(solver.getBooleanSort()), "cold")
quiet = solver.mkConst(solver.mkFunctionSort(solver.getBooleanSort()), "quiet")
red = solver.mkConst(solver.mkFunctionSort(solver.getBooleanSort()), "red")
white = solver.mkConst(solver.mkFunctionSort(solver.getBooleanSort()), "white")
```

Next, we translate each of the contextual statements:

1. If Fiona is cold and Fiona is young then Fiona is quiet.
```python
stmt1 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, Fiona_cold, Fiona_young), Fiona_quiet)
```

2. All red things are quiet.
```python
stmt2 = solver.mkForall([red], solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, red, quiet))
```

3. If something is smart and kind then it is young.
```python
stmt3 = solver.mkForall([smart, kind], solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, smart, kind), young))
```

4. If something is young and cold then it is red.
```python
stmt4 = solver.mkForall([young, cold], solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, young, cold), red))
```

5. If something is smart then it is red.
```python
stmt5 = solver.mkForall([smart], solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, smart, red))
```

6. If something is quiet then it is kind.
```python
stmt6 = solver.mkForall([quiet], solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, quiet, kind))
```

7. If Dave is smart and Dave is not cold then Dave is kind.
```python
stmt7 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, Dave_smart, solver.mkTerm(Kind.NOT, Dave_cold)), Dave_kind)
```

8. Young, smart things are white.
```python
stmt8 = solver.mkForall([young, smart], solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, young, smart), white))
```

9. Charlie is cold.
```python
stmt9 = Charlie_cold
```

10. Charlie is quiet.
```python
stmt10 = Charlie_quiet
```

11. Dave is cold.
```python
stmt11 = Dave_cold
```

12. Dave is smart.
```python
stmt12 = Dave_smart
```

13. Fiona is not kind.
```python
stmt13 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.NOT, Fiona_kind)
```

14. Harry is not kind.
```python
stmt14 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.NOT, Harry_kind)
```

15. Harry is young.
```python
stmt15 = Harry_young
```

Finally, we formulate the test statement: Dave is young.
```python
test_stmt = Dave_young
```

We now add all these statements to the solver and check the status of the test statement:
```python
# Add all the statements to the solver
solver.assertFormula(stmt1)
solver.assertFormula(stmt2)
solver.assertFormula(stmt3)
solver.assertFormula(stmt4)
solver.assertFormula(stmt5)
solver.assertFormula(stmt6)
solver.assertFormula(stmt7)
solver.assertFormula(stmt8)
solver.assertFormula(stmt9)
solver.assertFormula(stmt10)
solver.assertFormula(stmt11)
solver.assertFormula(stmt12)
solver.assertFormula(stmt13)
solver.assertFormula(stmt14)
solver.assertFormula(stmt15)

# Assert the test statement and check its status
solver.assertFormula(test_stmt)
result = solver.checkSat()

print("Test statement (Dave is young) is:", result)
```

Run this code inside a Python environment where CVC5 is installed to determine whether the test statement "Dave is young" is satisfied or not based on the contextual statements.
