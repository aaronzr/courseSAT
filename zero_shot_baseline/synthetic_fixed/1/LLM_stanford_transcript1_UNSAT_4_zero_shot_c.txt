END OF TRANSCRIPT.
==========================================Based on the provided degree requirements and the student's transcript, here is the detailed analysis:

### BS Core Requirements Analysis

1. **Programming Abstractions (CS106B)**
   - Taken in Winter 2019-2020, Grade: D+
   
2. **Computer Organization and Systems (CS107) or CS107E**
   - CS107E taken in Autumn 2020-2021, Grade: D
   
3. **Principles of Computer Systems (CS111)**
   - Taken in Autumn 2021-2022, Grade: D-
   
4. **Mathematical Foundations of Computing (CS103)**
   - Not taken
   
5. **Introduction to Probability for Computer Scientists (CS109)**
   - Taken in Winter 2020-2021, Grade: D+
   
6. **Data Structures and Algorithms (CS161)**
   - Taken in Autumn 2021-2022, Grade: D+
   
### Senior Project Requirements Analysis

1. The student did not complete any of the senior project courses (e.g., CS194, CS194W, CS210B, CS191, CS191W, CS294).

### Mathematics and Science Requirements Analysis

1. **Mathematics Requirements (26 units minimum)**
   - MATH 19: Taken in Autumn 2019-2020, Grade: D
   - MATH 51: Taken Autumn 2020-2021, Grade: D+
   - MATH 52: Taken Spring 2020-2021, Grade: D+
   - MATH 53: Taken Autumn 2022-2023, Grade: D+

   The total units for Mathematics: 16 units attempted, but several do not count due to grades below C-.

2. **Science Requirements (11 units minimum)**
   - PHYS 21: Taken in Winter 2019-2020, Grade: C+
   - PHYS 43: Taken in Spring 2019-2020, Grade: C-

   The total units for Science: 8 units attempted, 8 units earned.

### AI Track Core, Depth, and Elective Requirements Analysis

1. **Core (15 units minimum)**
   - CS107 or CS107E (already mentioned), Grade: D
   - CS111 (already mentioned), Grade: D-
   - CS161 (already mentioned), Grade: D+

2. **Track Requirements**
   - CS221: Artificial Intelligence - Winter 2021-2022, Grade: D
   - CS224N: Natural Language Processing - Spring 2021-2022, Grade: D
   - CS229: Machine Learning - Autumn 2022-2023, Grade: D+

### Conclusion

Alex Robert Wilson does **not** satisfy the required courses for the BS in Computer Science. The key deficiencies are:

- CS103 (Mathematical Foundations of Computing) is not taken.
- The grades in significant core courses (CS106B, CS107E, CS111, CS109, CS161, etc.) are below the required minimum (C-).
- The Mathematics requirement is not fulfilled (less than 26 units with acceptable grades).
- The Science requirement is partially fulfilled (needs 3 more units).
- No senior project course completed.
- The GPA for core, depth, and senior project courses is below the required minimum of 2.0.

**BS NOT SATISFIED**.

### MS Specialization Requirements Analysis

If the BS requirements are not satisfied, the student is not eligible for the MS.

**MS NOT SATISFIED**. 

The student must retake and improve grades in the deficient courses listed above and fulfill the remaining requirements in order to meet the degree requirements for the BS in Computer Science before considering the MS specialization in Artificial Intelligence.
