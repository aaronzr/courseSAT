Sure, let's go through each statement step by step and translate them into CVC5 SMT formulas using Python.

First, we need to import the CVC5 Python API and set up the solver. Here is what each translation will look like:

```python
import cvc5
from cvc5 import Kind

# Initialize solver
solver = cvc5.Solver()

# Declare sorts for entities and properties
Bool = solver.getBooleanSort()
Anne = solver.mkConst(Kind.CONST_RATIONAL, "Anne")
Charlie = solver.mkConst(Kind.CONST_RATIONAL, "Charlie")
Dave = solver.mkConst(Kind.CONST_RATIONAL, "Dave")
Gary = solver.mkConst(Kind.CONST_RATIONAL, "Gary")

smart = solver.mkPredicate(Bool, "smart")
kind = solver.mkPredicate(Bool, "kind")
cold = solver.mkPredicate(Bool, "cold")
blue = solver.mkPredicate(Bool, "blue")
young = solver.mkPredicate(Bool, "young")
nice = solver.mkPredicate(Bool, "nice")
quiet = solver.mkPredicate(Bool, "quiet")

# Contextual statements
# If Anne is smart and Anne is kind then Anne is cold.
stmt1 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES,
            solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, smart(Anne), kind(Anne)),
            cold(Anne))

# All smart, blue things are kind.
stmt2 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.FORALL,
            [Anne, Charlie, Dave, Gary],
            solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND,
                solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, smart(Anne), blue(Anne)),
                kind(Anne)))

# All young, cold things are kind.
stmt3 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.FORALL,
            [Anne, Charlie, Dave, Gary],
            solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND,
                solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, young(Anne), cold(Anne)),
                kind(Anne)))

# If something is nice and young then it is cold.
stmt4 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.FORALL,
            [Anne, Charlie, Dave, Gary],
            solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, nice(Anne), young(Anne)),
            cold(Anne))

# If something is cold then it is quiet.
stmt5 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.FORALL,
            [Anne, Charlie, Dave, Gary],
            solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, cold(Anne), quiet(Anne)))

# If something is kind then it is nice.
stmt6 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.FORALL,
            [Anne, Charlie, Dave, Gary],
            solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, kind(Anne), nice(Anne)))

# If something is nice and blue then it is young.
stmt7 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.FORALL,
            [Anne, Charlie, Dave, Gary],
            solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, nice(Anne), blue(Anne)),
            young(Anne))

# If something is quiet and cold then it is smart.
stmt8 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.FORALL,
            [Anne, Charlie, Dave, Gary],
            solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, quiet(Anne), cold(Anne)),
            smart(Anne))

# Facts about Anne
fact1 = blue(Anne)
fact2 = nice(Anne)
fact3 = quiet(Anne)
fact4 = smart(Anne)
fact5 = young(Anne)

# Facts about Charlie
fact6 = blue(Charlie)
fact7 = cold(Charlie)
fact8 = nice(Charlie)
fact9 = quiet(Charlie)
fact10 = smart(Charlie)
fact11 = young(Charlie)

# Facts about Dave
fact12 = blue(Dave)
fact13 = smart(Dave)

# Facts about Gary
fact14 = blue(Gary)
fact15 = cold(Gary)
fact16 = nice(Gary)

# Test statement: Gary is not smart
test_stmt = solver.mkNot(smart(Gary))

# Add all statements and facts to the solver
solver.assertFormula(stmt1)
solver.assertFormula(stmt2)
solver.assertFormula(stmt3)
solver.assertFormula(stmt4)
solver.assertFormula(stmt5)
solver.assertFormula(stmt6)
solver.assertFormula(stmt7)
solver.assertFormula(stmt8)
solver.assertFormula(fact1)
solver.assertFormula(fact2)
solver.assertFormula(fact3)
solver.assertFormula(fact4)
solver.assertFormula(fact5)
solver.assertFormula(fact6)
solver.assertFormula(fact7)
solver.assertFormula(fact8)
solver.assertFormula(fact9)
solver.assertFormula(fact10)
solver.assertFormula(fact11)
solver.assertFormula(fact12)
solver.assertFormula(fact13)
solver.assertFormula(fact14)
solver.assertFormula(fact15)
solver.assertFormula(fact16)

# Check the test statement
solver.assertFormula(test_stmt)

# Check satisfiability
result = solver.checkSat()
print(result)
```

This is the translation for the contextual statements and test statement. The check at the end will determine if "Gary is not smart" is satisfied based on the given information. If the output is `sat`, it means the statement "Gary is not smart" can be satisfied given the contextual information. If the output is `unsat`, it means it cannot be satisfied.
