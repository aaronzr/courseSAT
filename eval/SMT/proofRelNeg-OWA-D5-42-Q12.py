At the end, I will provide the test case to evaluate the test statement.

### Contextual Statements

1. **If the bald eagle eats the dog and the dog sees the bear then the dog is round.**
```python
from cvc5 import Solver, And, Implies, Function, Bool

solver = Solver()
Eats = Function("Eats", Bool, Bool)
Sees = Function("Sees", Bool, Bool)
Round = Function("Round", Bool)
Dog = Bool("Dog")
BaldEagle = Bool("BaldEagle")
Bear = Bool("Bear")

solver.add(Implies(And(Eats(BaldEagle, Dog), Sees(Dog, Bear)), Round(Dog)))
```

2. **If something eats the bald eagle and the bald eagle eats the bear then it sees the dog.**
```python
It = Bool("It")
solver.add(Forall(It, Implies(And(Eats(It, BaldEagle), Eats(BaldEagle, Bear)), Sees(It, Dog))))
```

3. **If something needs the dog and it is nice then the dog is kind.**
```python
Nice = Function("Nice", Bool)
Kind = Function("Kind", Bool)
Needs = Function("Needs", Bool)
solver.add(Forall(It, Implies(And(Needs(It, Dog), Nice(It)), Kind(Dog))))
```

4. **If the dog is round then the dog needs the bald eagle.**
```python
solver.add(Implies(Round(Dog), Needs(Dog, BaldEagle)))
```

5. **If something sees the dog and the dog eats the bear then it needs the bear.**
```python
solver.add(Forall(It, Implies(And(Sees(It, Dog), Eats(Dog, Bear)), Needs(It, Bear))))
```

6. **If something eats the tiger and the tiger eats the bear then the tiger needs the bear.**
```python
Tiger = Bool("Tiger")
solver.add(Forall(It, Implies(And(Eats(It, Tiger), Eats(Tiger, Bear)), Needs(Tiger, Bear))))
```

7. **If something needs the bear then it eats the bear.**
```python
solver.add(Forall(It, Implies(Needs(It, Bear), Eats(It, Bear))))
```

8. **If something eats the tiger and it does not need the bald eagle then the bald eagle is not big.**
```python
Big = Function("Big", Bool)
solver.add(Forall(It, Implies(And(Eats(It, Tiger), Not(Needs(It, BaldEagle))), Not(Big(BaldEagle)))))
```

9. **The bald eagle eats the dog.**
```python
solver.add(Eats(BaldEagle, Dog))
```

10. **The bald eagle is big.**
```python
solver.add(Big(BaldEagle))
```

11. **The bald eagle is kind.**
```python
solver.add(Kind(BaldEagle))
```

12. **The bald eagle is young.**
```python
Young = Function("Young", Bool)
solver.add(Young(BaldEagle))
```

13. **The bald eagle needs the tiger.**
```python
solver.add(Needs(BaldEagle, Tiger))
```

14. **The bald eagle sees the dog.**
```python
solver.add(Sees(BaldEagle, Dog))
```

15. **The bear sees the dog.**
```python
solver.add(Sees(Bear, Dog))
```

16. **The dog eats the bear.**
```python
solver.add(Eats(Dog, Bear))
```

17. **The dog is round.**
```python
solver.add(Round(Dog))
```

18. **The dog is young.**
```python
solver.add(Young(Dog))
```

19. **The dog needs the bear.**
```python
solver.add(Needs(Dog, Bear))
```

20. **The dog does not see the bald eagle.**
```python
solver.add(Not(Sees(Dog, BaldEagle)))
```

21. **The tiger eats the bald eagle.**
```python
solver.add(Eats(Tiger, BaldEagle))
```

22. **The tiger is nice.**
```python
solver.add(Nice(Tiger))
```

23. **The tiger needs the bald eagle.**
```python
solver.add(Needs(Tiger, BaldEagle))
```

24. **The tiger sees the bald eagle.**
```python
solver.add(Sees(Tiger, BaldEagle))
```

### Test Statement
**The tiger does not eat the bear.**
```python
# To verify this, we'll assert its negation and check for satisfiability
solver.add(Not(Eats(Tiger, Bear)))

result = solver.check()
if result.is_sat():
    print("The tiger does not eat the bear: Satisfied")
else:
    print("The tiger does not eat the bear: Unsatisfied")
```

### Complete Solver Script
This includes all the above statements and the test statement verification:
```python
from cvc5 import Solver, And, Implies, Function, Bool, Not, Forall

solver = Solver()
Eats = Function("Eats", Bool, Bool, Bool)
Sees = Function("Sees", Bool, Bool, Bool)
Round = Function("Round", Bool, Bool)
Kind = Function("Kind", Bool, Bool)
Needs = Function("Needs", Bool, Bool, Bool)
Big = Function("Big", Bool, Bool)
Young = Function("Young", Bool, Bool)
Nice = Function("Nice", Bool, Bool)

Dog = Bool("Dog")
BaldEagle = Bool("BaldEagle")
Bear = Bool("Bear")
Tiger = Bool("Tiger")
It = Bool("It")

# Add all contextual statements
solver.add(Implies(And(Eats(BaldEagle, Dog), Sees(Dog, Bear)), Round(Dog)))
solver.add(Forall(It, Implies(And(Eats(It, BaldEagle), Eats(BaldEagle, Bear)), Sees(It, Dog))))
solver.add(Forall(It, Implies(And(Needs(It, Dog), Nice(It)), Kind(Dog))))
solver.add(Implies(Round(Dog), Needs(Dog, BaldEagle)))
solver.add(Forall(It, Implies(And(Sees(It, Dog), Eats(Dog, Bear)), Needs(It, Bear))))
solver.add(Forall(It, Implies(And(Eats(It, Tiger), Eats(Tiger, Bear)), Needs(Tiger, Bear))))
solver.add(Forall(It, Implies(Needs(It, Bear), Eats(It, Bear))))
solver.add(Forall(It, Implies(And(Eats(It, Tiger), Not(Needs(It, BaldEagle))), Not(Big(BaldEagle)))))
solver.add(Eats(BaldEagle, Dog))
solver.add(Big(BaldEagle))
solver.add(Kind(BaldEagle))
solver.add(Young(BaldEagle))
solver.add(Needs(BaldEagle, Tiger))
solver.add(Sees(BaldEagle, Dog))
solver.add(Sees(Bear, Dog))
solver.add(Eats(Dog, Bear))
solver.add(Round(Dog))
solver.add(Young(Dog))
solver.add(Needs(Dog, Bear))
solver.add(Not(Sees(Dog, BaldEagle)))
solver.add(Eats(Tiger, BaldEagle))
solver.add(Nice(Tiger))
solver.add(Needs(Tiger, BaldEagle))
solver.add(Sees(Tiger, BaldEagle))

# Test statement
solver.add(Not(Eats(Tiger, Bear)))

# Check for satisfiability
result = solver.check()
if result.is_sat():
    print("The tiger does not eat the bear: Satisfied")
else:
    print("The tiger does not eat the bear: Unsatisfied")
```

Now, running this script will use the CVC5 SMT solver to evaluate whether "The tiger does not eat the bear" is satisfied or not given the translated contextual statements.
