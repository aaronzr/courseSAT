**AI Track Core, Depth, and Electives:**
- CS 221: AI: Principles and Techniques
- Track Requirement B (2 courses from different areas)
- Track Requirement C (1 course)
- Track Electives (3 courses)

**Other Requirements:**

Given these analysis, Sandra Marie Lewinsky's transcript does **not** completely satisfy all the BS degree requirements in Computer Science with an AI track.

### Output:
```
- CS 106B: Programming Abstractions
- CS 111: Operating Systems Principles
- CS 103: Mathematical Foundations of Computing
- CS 161: Design and Analysis of Algorithms
- Senior Project Course (CS 191/W, CS 194/W, or CS 210B)
- CS 221: AI: Principles and Techniques
- Track Requirement B (2 courses each from different areas)
- Track Requirement C (1 course)
- Track Electives (3 courses)
- Technology in Society course
```========================GPT Answer to Prompt Two Regarding MS Requirements====================
To determine if Sandra Marie Lewinsky satisfies the requirements for the MS in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence (AI) at Stanford, we'll go through each of the specified requirements and compare them to her transcript:

### Foundations Requirement
1. **Logic, Automata & Complexity** 
   - Course: CS 103 COMPUTER THEORY (Withdrawn as an undergraduate)
   
2. **Probability**
   - Course: CS 109 INTRO TO PROBABILITY & STATISTICS (A- as an undergraduate)
   
3. **Algorithmic Analysis**
   - Not Found on Transcript (CS 161 required)

4. **Computer Organization & Systems**
   - Course: CS 107 COMPUTER ORGANIZATION (B+ as an undergraduate)
   
5. **Principles of Computer Systems**
   - Not Found on Transcript (CS 110/CS 111 required)

**Total Units for Foundations (May not exceed 10 units):**
This would be recalculated for MS if needed.

### Significant Implementation Requirement
The course must be one of the listed courses and taken at Stanford for a letter grade.

- Not Found on Transcript (Courses like CS 140/CS 140E/CS 143, etc.)

### Breadth Requirement
Courses to be chosen from three different areas A, B, C, or D and must be taken for at least 3 units each:

1. **Area A**: 
   - Not Taken
   
2. **Area B**: 
   - Not Taken
   
3. **Area C**: 
   - Not Taken
   
4. **Area D**: 
   - Not Taken
   
### Artificial Intelligence Depth
- **Required CS 221**: 
  - Not Found on Transcript

Other Depth Courses Listed:
- None found from her transcript from list of AI Depth courses (specified courses)

**Total Depth Units Applied to MSCS**: Must total at least 21 units.
- Not met

### Electives
- Not enough details in the transcript about electives at the graduate level to verify completion.


### Additional Requirements
1. **At most 10 units of Foundations requirement courses may be counted toward your 45 units.**
2. **At most 3 units of 1-2 unit seminars may be counted toward your 45 units.**
3. **At least 36 units submitted for the MSCS degree including all courses taken for breadth and depth must be taken for a letter grade.**
4. **The average grade in the courses submitted for the MSCS must be at least a B (3.0 in Stanfordâ€™s GPA scale).**
   - BS GPA is 3.091; assuming similar performance, this is likely met but needs confirmation.
5. **Units previously applied toward BS requirements may not also be counted toward the MSCS.**
6. **You must complete at least 45 graduate units at Stanford before receiving the MSCS degree.**
   - Exact graduate units not confirmable without full MS transcript.


Given the analysis of the given transcript and the requirements not yet met, the output should be:

### Missing Course Requirements
1. Algorithmic Analysis (CS 161)
2. Principles of Computer Systems (CS 110/CS 111)
3. Significant Implementation course (any one from the list)
4. Depth Course Requirements (CS 221 and 21 units of specific AI courses)
5. Breadth Requirement courses (from areas A, B, C, D)

### Conclusion
Sandra Marie Lewinsky has several MSCS requirements outstanding. Therefore, the output is:
```
Courses not satisfied: CS 161, CS 110/111, CS 221, Significant Implementation course, Breadth Requirement courses in areas A, B, C, and D
```
