['If someone is big then they are nice.', 'If someone is big then they are nice.', 'Green, smart people are nice.', 'All smart people are green.', 'All nice people are big.', 'White, cold people are not big.', 'All cold people are smart.', 'All nice, kind people are not white.', 'Nice, big people are kind.', 'Anne is cold.', 'Anne is smart.', 'Bob is not big.', 'Erin is kind.', 'Erin is not smart.', 'Gary is kind.', 'Gary is white.']Anne is white.Certainly! Let's follow a structured approach to translate each contextual statement into CVC5 python formulas and then create a test case for the given test statement "Anne is white." We'll use the `cvc5` SMT solver library in Python.

Firstly, we'll establish the relevant properties and entities and then translate each statement:

**Step 1: Define the entities and properties.**
Entities: Anne, Bob, Erin, Gary  
Properties: big, nice, green, smart, cold, kind, white

**Step 2: Translate each contextual statement into CVC5 python formula.**

```python
import cvc5
from cvc5 import Kind

solver = cvc5.Solver()

# Sorts
Boolean = solver.getBooleanSort()

# Declare entities
anne = solver.mkConst(Boolean, "Anne")
bob = solver.mkConst(Boolean, "Bob")
erin = solver.mkConst(Boolean, "Erin")
gary = solver.mkConst(Boolean, "Gary")

# Declare properties
big = solver.mkPredicate(Boolean, "big")
nice = solver.mkPredicate(Boolean, "nice")
green = solver.mkPredicate(Boolean, "green")
smart = solver.mkPredicate(Boolean, "smart")
cold = solver.mkPredicate(Boolean, "cold")
kind = solver.mkPredicate(Boolean, "kind")
white = solver.mkPredicate(Boolean, "white")

# Contextual statements
statements = []

# If someone is big then they are nice.
stmt1 = solver.mkForall([anne], solver.mkImplication(big(anne), nice(anne)))
# Green, smart people are nice.
stmt2 = solver.mkForall([anne], solver.mkImplication(solver.mkAnd(green(anne), smart(anne)), nice(anne)))
# All smart people are green.
stmt3 = solver.mkForall([anne], solver.mkImplication(smart(anne), green(anne)))
# All nice people are big.
stmt4 = solver.mkForall([anne], solver.mkImplication(nice(anne), big(anne)))
# White, cold people are not big.
stmt5 = solver.mkForall([anne], solver.mkImplication(solver.mkAnd(white(anne), cold(anne)), solver.mkNot(big(anne))))
# All cold people are smart.
stmt6 = solver.mkForall([anne], solver.mkImplication(cold(anne), smart(anne)))
# All nice, kind people are not white.
stmt7 = solver.mkForall([anne], solver.mkImplication(solver.mkAnd(nice(anne), kind(anne)), solver.mkNot(white(anne))))
# Nice, big people are kind.
stmt8 = solver.mkForall([anne], solver.mkImplication(solver.mkAnd(nice(anne), big(anne)), kind(anne)))
# Anne is cold.
stmt9 = cold(anne)
# Anne is smart.
stmt10 = smart(anne)
# Bob is not big.
stmt11 = solver.mkNot(big(bob))
# Erin is kind.
stmt12 = kind(erin)
# Erin is not smart.
stmt13 = solver.mkNot(smart(erin))
# Gary is kind.
stmt14 = kind(gary)
# Gary is white.
stmt15 = white(gary)

# Add all statements to the solver
for stmt in [stmt1, stmt2, stmt3, stmt4, stmt5, stmt6, stmt7, stmt8, stmt9, stmt10, stmt11, stmt12, stmt13, stmt14, stmt15]:
    solver.assertFormula(stmt)

# Test statement: Anne is white.
test_stmt = white(anne)

solver.push()
solver.assertFormula(test_stmt)
result = solver.checkSat()
if result.isSat():
    print("The test statement 'Anne is white.' is satisfied.")
else:
    print("The test statement 'Anne is white.' is not satisfied.")
solver.pop()
```

**Explanation of Translation:**

1. **Predicate Declarations:** Each entity (Anne, Bob, Erin, Gary) and property (big, nice, green, smart, cold, kind, white) is declared.
2. **Contextual Statements:** Each contextual statement is formulated as a logical expression using the SMT classes and functions:
   - `mkImplication(a, b)` creates `a ⇒ b`
   - `mkAnd(a, b)` creates `a ∧ b`
   - `mkNot(a)` creates `¬a`
   - `mkForall([x], p)` quantifies over `x`

3. **Assertion of Statements:** Each translated statement is asserted to the solver to build the logical context.
4. **Test Statement:** The test statement "Anne is white." is asserted temporarily to check for satisfiability.

Running this Python script with the CVC5 SMT solver should evaluate the test statement based on the contextual information provided.
