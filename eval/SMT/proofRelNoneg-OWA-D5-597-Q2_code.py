To translate these natural language statements into CVC5 SMT Python formulas, we will first identify the relevant parameters (entities and properties). We'll then convert each statement into an equivalent logical formula.

Here are the contextual statements along with the test statement:

1. If something sees the rabbit then it eats the rabbit.
2. If something sees the lion and it is blue then the lion sees the dog.
3. If something eats the rabbit then it eats the dog.
4. If something is green and it sees the lion then the lion eats the rabbit.
5. If something is rough then it eats the lion.
6. If something eats the dog and it eats the lion then the lion sees the rabbit.
7. If something is rough and it sees the lion then the lion is blue.
8. The bald eagle eats the lion.
9. The bald eagle needs the rabbit.
10. The bald eagle sees the dog.
11. The bald eagle sees the rabbit.
12. The dog eats the bald eagle.
13. The dog eats the rabbit.
14. The dog needs the lion.
15. The lion needs the bald eagle.
16. The lion needs the dog.
17. The rabbit eats the lion.
18. The rabbit is green.
19. The rabbit is round.
20. The bald eagle does not need the rabbit.

Now let's translate these statements into CVC5 SMT Python formulas:

```python
import cvc5
from cvc5 import Kind

# Create a solver instance
solver = cvc5.Solver()

# Define sorts
Bool = solver.getBooleanSort()

# Define entities
bald_eagle = solver.mkConst(Bool, "bald_eagle")
dog = solver.mkConst(Bool, "dog")
lion = solver.mkConst(Bool, "lion")
rabbit = solver.mkConst(Bool, "rabbit")
X = solver.mkVar(Bool, "X")

# Define predicates
sees = lambda x, y: solver.mkConst(Bool, f"sees_{x}_{y}")
eats = lambda x, y: solver.mkConst(Bool, f"eats_{x}_{y}")
needs = lambda x, y: solver.mkConst(Bool, f"needs_{x}_{y}")
is_blue = lambda x: solver.mkConst(Bool, f"is_blue_{x}")
is_green = lambda x: solver.mkConst(Bool, f"is_green_{x}")
is_rough = lambda x: solver.mkConst(Bool, f"is_rough_{x}")

# Add constraints to the solver
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkImplies(sees(X, rabbit), eats(X, rabbit)))
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkImplies(solver.mkAnd(sees(X, lion), is_blue(X)), sees(lion, dog)))
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkImplies(eats(X, rabbit), eats(X, dog)))
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkImplies(solver.mkAnd(is_green(X), sees(X, lion)), eats(lion, rabbit)))
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkImplies(is_rough(X), eats(X, lion)))
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkImplies(solver.mkAnd(eats(X, dog), eats(X, lion)), sees(lion, rabbit)))
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkImplies(solver.mkAnd(is_rough(X), sees(X, lion)), is_blue(lion)))
solver.assertFormula(eats(bald_eagle, lion))
solver.assertFormula(needs(bald_eagle, rabbit))
solver.assertFormula(sees(bald_eagle, dog))
solver.assertFormula(sees(bald_eagle, rabbit))
solver.assertFormula(eats(dog, bald_eagle))
solver.assertFormula(eats(dog, rabbit))
solver.assertFormula(needs(dog, lion))
solver.assertFormula(needs(lion, bald_eagle))
solver.assertFormula(needs(lion, dog))
solver.assertFormula(eats(rabbit, lion))
solver.assertFormula(is_green(rabbit))
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkConst(Bool, "is_round_rabbit"))

# Test statement: The bald eagle does not need the rabbit.
test_statement = solver.mkNot(needs(bald_eagle, rabbit))

# Check satisfiability of the test statement
solver.push()
solver.assertFormula(test_statement)
result = solver.checkSat()
solver.pop()

print("The test statement (The bald eagle does not need the rabbit) is:", result)
```

This script defines the entities and predicates in the form of CVC5 constants, constructs the logical formulas based on the given contextual statements, and then checks the satisfiability of the test statement. 

The output will indicate whether the statement "The bald eagle does not need the rabbit" is satisfiable (SAT), unsatisfiable (UNSAT), or unknown given the provided constraints.
