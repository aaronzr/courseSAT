Certainly! Here is the natural language translation of the given SMT formulas:

1. You must take exactly 5 units in each of the following five foundation categories:
   - Logic, Automata & Complexity (course_a_units = 5)
   - Probability (course_b_units = 5)
   - Algorithmic Analysis (course_c_units = 5)
   - Computer Organization & Systems (course_d_units = 5)
   - Principles of Computer Systems (course_e_units = 5)

2. The courses that can be taken in each category are as follows:
   - Logic, Automata & Complexity: CME 100, CME 102, CME 104, CS 106B, CME 106 (4 units)
   - Probability: CME 100, CME 102, CME 104, CS 106B, CME 106 (4 units)
   - Algorithmic Analysis: CME 100, CME 102, CME 104, CS 106B, CME 106 (4 units)
   - Computer Organization & Systems: CME 100, CME 102, CME 104, CS 106B, CME 106 (4 units)
   - Principles of Computer Systems: CME 100, CME 102, CME 104, CS 106B, CME 106 (4 units)

3. There is a contradiction in the current assignments, as indicated by the following assertion, which essentially invalidates the current model:
   - Taking any course will imply that you cannot satisfy all categories if the total unit count does not exceed 10.

4. The equivalence of courses required in the Logic, Automata & Complexity category with other categories are provided but appear to be technically incorrect due to an apparent contradiction.
   - Course options such as CS 103, CS109, Stat116, CME106, MS&E220, and EE178, among others, are stated equivalently, which implies that you have flexibility but suggests overlap which pieces of logic contradict.

5. The final assertion suggests an overlapping requirement that conflicts with the initial setup where only one course cannot satisfy multiple categories.

### Summary:
The SMT formula attempts to satisfy conflicting constraints where an individual course cannot fulfill multiple foundations categories in a way that satisfies all unit and course requirements. The resulting constraints are contradictory, indicating that the current model is infeasible under the provided natural language requirements.
