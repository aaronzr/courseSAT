### Summary
Samantha Mae Fisher has completed all necessary coursework and requirements for the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Stanford University.

### Conclusion
**BS SAT**========================GPT Answer to Prompt Two Regarding MS Requirements====================
Based on the student's transcript provided, here's a thorough analysis of whether the requirements for the MS in Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence Specialization are satisfied:

### 1. Foundations Requirement:

#### Required Courses:
- **Logic, Automata & Complexity (CS103)**: Taken and passed (Grade: B)
- **Probability (CS109, Stat116, CME106, MS&E220, or EE178)**: CS109 taken and passed (Grade: A)
- **Algorithmic Analysis (CS161)**: Taken and passed (Grade: B+)
- **Computer Org & Sys (CS107 or 107E)**: CS107 taken and passed (Grade: A-)
- **Principles of Computer Systems (CS110 or CS111)**: CS111 taken and passed (Grade: B+)

The transcript shows that the student has satisfied all the foundation requirements during their undergraduate degree.

### 2. Significant Implementation Requirement:
Eligible courses include CS 140, 140E, 143, 144, 145, 148, 151, 190, 210B, 212, 221, 227B, 231N, 243, 248/248A, and 341.

- **CS 194 Software Project Experience**: (Grade: A-) is an implementation-heavy course, but it's not listed as one that satisfies the Significant Implementation Requirement. If this was taken during MS and counted towards a core requirement, that could be valid but needs advisor approval. No explicit evidence of this course fulfilling the specific implementation requirement.

### 3. Breadth Requirement:
The student needs to complete three courses from different areas (A, B, C, D).

#### Area courses:
- **Area A. Mathematical and Theoretical Foundations**: No course from Area A found in the transcript.
- **Area B. Computer Systems**: No course from Area B found in the transcript.
- **Area C. Applications**: CS 229 (Machine Learning), CS 224N, CS 224U, and CS 231A are all from Area C.
- **Area D. Computing and Society**: No course from Area D found in the transcript.

Based on the provided transcript, the student has not satisfied the Breadth requirement since we need three courses from different areas. They have multiple from the same area (Area C) but none from Areas A, B, and D.

### 4. Artificial Intelligence Depth Requirement:
A total of at least 21 units from depth courses, including at least four courses from the provided AI Depth list.

- **CS 221**: Taken and passed (3 units, Grade: A-)
- At least four of: CS 224N, 224U, 231A, 234, 237A etc.:
  - **CS 224N**: (3 units, Grade: A) 
  - **CS 224U**: (3 units, Grade: A)
  - **CS 231A**: (3 units, Grade: B+)
  - **CS 234**: (3 units, Grade: A)
  - **CS 238**: (3 units, Grade: A-)

The student has taken five relevant courses. 

### Total Depth Units:
- CS 221 (3 units)
- CS 224N (3 units)
- CS 224U (3 units)
- CS 231A (3 units)
- CS 234 (3 units)
- CS 238 (3 units)

Total: 18 units (needs 21 units from depth courses, so 3 units short).

### 5. Electives:
A total of 45 graduate units required. The transcript however does not include courses taken specifically during MS. Thus, an analysis could not include these.

### Additional Requirements:
- **Must be at least 45 graduate units from Stanford**: Needs verification from additional MS taken courses.
- **Must be taken for a letter grade**: The undergraduate courses were letter graded.
- **Average grade must be at least a B**: UG Cum GPA is 3.710 defining work ethic/value.

### Conclusion:
Based on the student's transcript, requirements that have not been explicitly satisfied:

1. **Breadth Requirements**: Needs courses from Areas A, B, and D.
2. **Depth Units**: Only 18 units from depth, needing 21 units.
3. **Significant Implementation Requirement**: Needs a listed course grading verification.

### Output:
```
Courses not satisfied: Breadth Requirement (Areas A, B, and D), Depth Units (3 units short), and Significant Implementation Requirement not clear.
```
