We will also generate a test case to ensure that the logic and syntax of the code are correct.

First, we will define the entities and their properties in Python using the CVC5 SMT solver.

```python
import cvc5
from cvc5 import Kind

# Initialize solver
solver = cvc5.Solver()

# Set logic
solver.setLogic("QF_UF")

# Define sorts (types)
Entity = solver.mkUninterpretedSort("Entity")

# Define constants
bald_eagle = solver.mkConst(Entity, "bald_eagle")
rabbit = solver.mkConst(Entity, "rabbit")
cow = solver.mkConst(Entity, "cow")
mouse = solver.mkConst(Entity, "mouse")

# Define predicates
round = solver.mkPredicate(Entity, "round")
chases = solver.mkPredicate([Entity, Entity], "chases")
young = solver.mkPredicate(Entity, "young")
likes = solver.mkPredicate([Entity, Entity], "likes")
visits = solver.mkPredicate([Entity, Entity], "visits")
kind = solver.mkPredicate(Entity, "kind")

# Define contextual statements
statements = []

# 'If something is round then it chases the rabbit.'
x = solver.mkBoundVar(Entity, "x")
statements.append(solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, round(x), chases(x, rabbit)))

# 'If something chases the cow then it is young.'
y = solver.mkBoundVar(Entity, "y")
statements.append(solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, chases(y, cow), young(y)))

# 'If the bald eagle likes the rabbit and the rabbit chases the cow then the bald eagle does not visit the cow.'
statements.append(solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, 
                                solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, likes(bald_eagle, rabbit), chases(rabbit, cow)), 
                                solver.mkTerm(Kind.NOT, visits(bald_eagle, cow))))

# 'If the bald eagle chases the rabbit then the rabbit is round.'
statements.append(solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, chases(bald_eagle, rabbit), round(rabbit)))

# 'If something is young and it likes the rabbit then it is green.'
z = solver.mkBoundVar(Entity, "z")
green = solver.mkPredicate(Entity, "green")
statements.append(solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, 
                                solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, young(z), likes(z, rabbit)), 
                                green(z)))

# 'If something is green then it is round.'
statements.append(solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, green(z), round(z)))

# 'If the rabbit likes the bald eagle then the bald eagle is round.'
statements.append(solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, likes(rabbit, bald_eagle), round(bald_eagle)))

# 'If something chases the bald eagle then it likes the bald_eagle.'
w = solver.mkBoundVar(Entity, "w")
statements.append(solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, chases(w, bald_eagle), likes(w, bald_eagle)))

# 'If something is green and it likes the cow then it visits the rabbit.'
v = solver.mkBoundVar(Entity, "v")
statements.append(solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, 
                                solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, green(v), likes(v, cow)), 
                                visits(v, rabbit)))

# 'The bald eagle chases the cow.'
statements.append(chases(bald_eagle, cow))

# 'The bald eagle likes the rabbit.'
statements.append(likes(bald_eagle, rabbit))

# 'The bald eagle visits the cow.'
statements.append(visits(bald_eagle, cow))

# 'The cow is not young.'
statements.append(solver.mkTerm(Kind.NOT, young(cow)))

# 'The mouse chases the rabbit.'
statements.append(chases(mouse, rabbit))

# 'The mouse likes the bald eagle.'
statements.append(likes(mouse, bald_eagle))

# 'The mouse likes the cow.'
statements.append(likes(mouse, cow))

# 'The mouse does not like the rabbit.'
statements.append(solver.mkTerm(Kind.NOT, likes(mouse, rabbit)))

# 'The rabbit chases the mouse.'
statements.append(chases(rabbit, mouse))

# 'The rabbit is kind.'
statements.append(kind(rabbit))

# 'The rabbit is young.'
statements.append(young(rabbit))

# 'The rabbit likes the cow.'
statements.append(likes(rabbit, cow))

# Test statement: 'The bald eagle is not round.'
test_statement = solver.mkTerm(Kind.NOT, round(bald_eagle))

# Add all statements to the solver
for stmt in statements:
    solver.assertFormula(stmt)

# Check test statement
solver.assertFormula(test_statement)
result = solver.checkSat()

print(f"Is the test statement '{test_statement}' satisfiable? {result}")

if result == cvc5.Result.UNSAT:
    print("Test statement is unsatisfied.")
elif result == cvc5.Result.SAT:
    print("Test statement is satisfied.")
else:  # Result.UNKNOWN
    print("Could not determine the satisfaction of the test statement.")
```

This Python code block outlines the entire translation of each statement into CVC5 SMT formulas using the CVC5 Python API. The test statement is also evaluated using the solver. Please run this code in an environment where the CVC5 library is installed and configured to see the result.
