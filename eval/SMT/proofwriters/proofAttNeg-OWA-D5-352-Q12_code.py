Sure, let's break down each contextual statement and translate them into CVC5 Python formulas. 

We'll start by defining the possible attributes for people: smart, furry, red, young, big, nice, and round. Each person will also be declared as an entity. 

We will then assert the relationships provided by the statements and end with the test statement.

Here's the translation:

1. **Contextual Statements:**
   - "Smart people are furry."
   - "Red people are furry."
   - "If Erin is young then Erin is big."
   - "Big people are nice."
   - "All round, furry people are young."
   - "All nice people are young."
   - "Nice, round people are not red."
   - "Bob is big."
   - "Bob is red."
   - "Bob is smart."
   - "Bob is young."
   - "Erin is round."
   - "Erin is smart."
   - "Gary is round."
   - "Harry is nice."
   - "Harry is red."
   - "Harry is not round."
   - "Harry is smart."
   - "Harry is young."

2. **Test Statement:**
   - "Erin is red."

Now let's translate these into CVC5 Python code:

```python
import cvc5
from cvc5 import Kind

# Initialize the solver
solver = cvc5.Solver()

# Declare sorts
Person = solver.getFiniteSort("Person")

# Declare People
Bob = solver.mkConst(Person, "Bob")
Erin = solver.mkConst(Person, "Erin")
Gary = solver.mkConst(Person, "Gary")
Harry = solver.mkConst(Person, "Harry")

# Declare predicates
smart = solver.mkUnaryFunction(Person, solver.getBooleanSort(), "smart")
furry = solver.mkUnaryFunction(Person, solver.getBooleanSort(), "furry")
red = solver.mkUnaryFunction(Person, solver.getBooleanSort(), "red")
young = solver.mkUnaryFunction(Person, solver.getBooleanSort(), "young")
big = solver.mkUnaryFunction(Person, solver.getBooleanSort(), "big")
nice = solver.mkUnaryFunction(Person, solver.getBooleanSort(), "nice")
round = solver.mkUnaryFunction(Person, solver.getBooleanSort(), "round")

# Contextual Statements

# Smart people are furry.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkForall([Person], solver.mkImplied(smart(Person), furry(Person))))

# Red people are furry.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkForall([Person], solver.mkImplied(red(Person), furry(Person))))

# If Erin is young then Erin is big.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkImplied(young(Erin), big(Erin)))

# Big people are nice.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkForall([Person], solver.mkImplied(big(Person), nice(Person))))

# All round, furry people are young.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkForall([Person], solver.mkImplied(solver.mkAnd(round(Person), furry(Person)), young(Person))))

# All nice people are young.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkForall([Person], solver.mkImplied(nice(Person), young(Person))))

# Nice, round people are not red.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkForall([Person], solver.mkImplied(solver.mkAnd(nice(Person), round(Person)), solver.mkNot(red(Person)))))

# Bob is big.
solver.assertFormula(big(Bob))

# Bob is red.
solver.assertFormula(red(Bob))

# Bob is smart.
solver.assertFormula(smart(Bob))

# Bob is young.
solver.assertFormula(young(Bob))

# Erin is round.
solver.assertFormula(round(Erin))

# Erin is smart.
solver.assertFormula(smart(Erin))

# Gary is round.
solver.assertFormula(round(Gary))

# Harry is nice.
solver.assertFormula(nice(Harry))

# Harry is red.
solver.assertFormula(red(Harry))

# Harry is not round.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkNot(round(Harry)))

# Harry is smart.
solver.assertFormula(smart(Harry))

# Harry is young.
solver.assertFormula(young(Harry))

# Test Statement: Erin is red.
test_formula = red(Erin)
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkNot(test_formula))

# Check for satisfiability
result = solver.checkSat()
if result.isSat():
    print("SAT: The test statement 'Erin is red' is satisfied.")
else:
    print("UNSAT: The test statement 'Erin is red' is not satisfied.")
```

In this code:
- We declare the sort `Person` for each individual person.
- We declare predicates for each attribute (smart, furry, red, young, big, nice, round).
- We assert the relationships and conditions provided by the contextual statements.
- We also assert the negation of the test statement to check if the opposite would be satisfiable.

Finally, we check for satisfiability using `result = solver.checkSat()` and print either "SAT" or "UNSAT" based on the evaluation of the test statement.

Remember to adapt the predicates' syntax and usage to the proper API calls of the cvc5 Python interface as needed.
