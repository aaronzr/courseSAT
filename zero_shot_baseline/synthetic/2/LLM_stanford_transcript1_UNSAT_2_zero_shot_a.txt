==========================================### BS Degree Requirements Analysis
Based on the details provided for the BS core requirements, senior project requirements, and AI elective requirements, let's analyze if the transcript of Sophia Marie Perez satisfies these requirements.

#### Core Requirements
1. **CS 106B Programming Abstractions**: Grade B-
2. **CS 107 Computer Organization and Systems**: Grade C+
3. **CS 111 Operating Systems Principles**: Grade C+
4. **CS 103 Mathematical Foundations of Computing**: Grade D+
5. **CS 109 Introduction to Probability for Computer Scientists**: Grade D
6. **CS 161 Data Structures and Algorithms**: Grade F

**Minimum GPA Requirement for Core and Depth Courses**: 2.0 (Sophia’s GPA does not meet this due to failing grades in major courses like CS 161, and low grades in CS courses CS 103 and CS 109)

#### Senior Project Requirement
No evidence of the completion of a senior project or courses like CS 194, CS 210B, CS 191/W.

#### AI Electives
1. **CS 123 Robotics**: Grade C
2. **CS 124 Natural Language Processing**: Grade D+

Sophia did not complete many of the required AI electives with the necessary grade requirements. Crucial courses like **CS 221 AI: Principles and Techniques** are missing or failed (CS 221: Grade F).

#### Engineering Fundamentals
1. **ENGR 40M An Intro to Making: What is EE?**: Grade B+
2. **EE 101A Circuits I**: Grade B-

#### Math Requirements
1. **MATH 51 Linear Algebra and Differential Calculus**: Grade C

#### Science Requirements
1. **PHYSICS 41 Mechanics**: Grade B-
2. **PHYSICS 43 Electricity and Magnetism**: Grade B+

### Courses Not Satisfied for BS
1. **CS 103 Mathematical Foundations of Computing**: Grade D+
2. **CS 109 Introduction to Probability for Computer Scientists**: Grade D
3. **CS 161 Data Structures and Algorithms**: Grade F
4. **CS 221 AI: Principles and Techniques**: Grade F
5. **Senior Project**: Not Attempted or Completed

**Output**: List of courses not satisfied:
- CS 103
- CS 109
- CS 161
- CS 221
- Senior Project requirement

### MS Degree Requirements Analysis
Let's also determine whether Sophia satisfies the MS specialization requirements for the Artificial Intelligence track.

#### Foundations Requirement
1. **CS 103 Logic, Automata & Complexity**: Grade D+
2. **CS 109, Stat116, CME106, MS&E220 or EE178 Probability**: Grade D (CS 109)
3. **CS 161 Algorithmic Analysis**: Grade F
4. **CS 107 or 107E Computer Organization & Systems**: Grade C+
5. **CS 110 or CS 111 Principles of Computer Systems**: Grade C+

Sophia fails the foundation requirements due to low grades in CS 103, CS 109, and failing grade in CS 161.

#### Artificial Intelligence Depth
Failing **CS 221 AI: Principles and Techniques** (Grade F), alongside grades below ‘B’ in additional required electives such as CS 124, indicates the depth requirements are unmet.

#### Significant Implementation Requirement
No evidence from the transcript of taking a specified course satisfying the Significant Implementation Requirement in the master's program.

#### Breadth Requirements
Completion records of courses need to show that courses from three separate areas (A, B, C, and D) were taken fulfilling this MS requirement. Sophia’s transcript does not show such evidence clearly.

**Output**: List of courses not satisfied for MS
1. **CS 103**
2. **CS 109**
3. **CS 161**
4. **CS 221**
5. **Significant Implementation Requirement**
6. **Breadth Requirements completion**

### Final Summary

**BS Degree Status**: Unmet requirements.
**MS Degree Status**: Unmet requirements. 

Sophia's current academic standing indicates that she has not met the requirements for graduating with a BS in Computer Science nor progressing satisfactorily in the MS specialization in Artificial Intelligence. 

**Recommendations**: 
- Retaking and passing failed or low-graded courses (CS 103, CS 109, CS 161, CS 221).
- Successfully completing a Senior Project.
- Ensuring GPA meets the minimum 2.0 in core, depth, and senior project courses combined. 
- Meeting the Significant Implementation and Breadth Requirements for MS.
