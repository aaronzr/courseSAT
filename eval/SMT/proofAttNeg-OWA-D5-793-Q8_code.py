Let's start by importing cvc5 and setting up the SMT solver. Then we'll translate each of the contextual statements into CVC5 python formulas and create a test case for the given test statement.

```python
import cvc5

solver = cvc5.Solver()

# Define sorts (types)
Bool = solver.getBooleanSort()

# Define constants
Bob = solver.mkConst(Bool, "Bob")
Charlie = solver.mkConst(Bool, "Charlie")
Dave = solver.mkConst(Bool, "Dave")
Gary = solver.mkConst(Bool, "Gary")

# Define properties
blue = solver.mkParam(Bool, "blue")
white = solver.mkParam(Bool, "white")
red = solver.mkParam(Bool, "red")
cold = solver.mkParam(Bool, "cold")
green = solver.mkParam(Bool, "green")
smart = solver.mkParam(Bool, "smart")
nice = solver.mkParam(Bool, "nice")

# Contextual Statements
stmt1 = solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.IMPLIES, 
                      solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.APPLY_UF, blue, Bob), 
                      solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.APPLY_UF, white, Bob))
stmt2 = solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.FORALL, [red, cold], 
                      solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.IMPLIES, 
                                    solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.AND, red, cold), 
                                    green))

                      solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.IMPLIES, 
                                    solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.AND, red, smart), 
                                    nice))

                                    red))

                      solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.APPLY_UF, nice, Dave), 
                      solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.APPLY_UF, cold, Dave))

                       solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.APPLY_UF, cold, Charlie))

# Test statement
test_stmt = solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.NOT, 
                          solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.APPLY_UF, nice, Bob))

solver.assertFormula(test_stmt)

# Check for satisfiability of test statement
satisfiability = solver.checkSat()

print(f"Satisfiability of the test statement: {satisfiability}")
```

Explanation of each step:
1. We initialize the CVC5 Solver.
2. We define the Boolean sort and constants for individuals (Bob, Charlie, Dave, Gary).
3. We define parameters for the various properties (blue, white, red, etc.).
4. We translate each contextual statement into CVC5 formulas.
5. We add each formula to the solver.
6. We translate the test statement ("Bob is not nice") into a formula.
7. We assert the test statement in the solver and check for its satisfiability.

Note: You will need to ensure the cvc5 python bindings are installed and properly configured to run this example.
