In order to do this, we'll follow these steps:
1. Identify the parameters present in each statement (like individuals and predicates).
2. Translate each statement into the CVC5 SMT formula format.

### Step-by-Step Translation:

Here are the translations of each contextual statement into CVC5 SMT formulas:

1. **If someone is round and they eat the lion then they visit the lion.**

```python
# Define variables
x = solver.mkVar("x", solver.mkSort("Person"))

# Formula: If someone is round and they eat the lion then they visit the lion.
stmt1 = solver.mkImplication(
    solver.mkTerm(
        solver.AND,
        solver.mkTerm(solver.APPLY_UF, is_round, x),
        solver.mkTerm(solver.APPLY_UF, eats, x, lion)
    ),
    solver.mkTerm(solver.APPLY_UF, visits, x, lion)
)
```

2. **If someone sees the cat then they visit the bald eagle.**

```python
# Formula: If someone sees the cat then they visit the bald eagle.
stmt2 = solver.mkImplication(
    solver.mkTerm(solver.APPLY_UF, sees, x, cat),
    solver.mkTerm(solver.APPLY_UF, visits, x, bald_eagle)
)
```

3. **If someone visits the bald eagle then they see the bald eagle.**

```python
# Formula: If someone visits the bald eagle then they see the bald eagle.
stmt3 = solver.mkImplication(
    solver.mkTerm(solver.APPLY_UF, visits, x, bald_eagle),
    solver.mkTerm(solver.APPLY_UF, sees, x, bald_eagle)
)
```

4. **If someone is young and they eat the lion then they are blue.**

```python
# Formula: If someone is young and they eat the lion then they are blue.
stmt4 = solver.mkImplication(
    solver.mkTerm(
        solver.AND,
        solver.mkTerm(solver.APPLY_UF, is_young, x),
        solver.mkTerm(solver.APPLY_UF, eats, x, lion)
    ),
    solver.mkTerm(solver.APPLY_UF, is_blue, x)
)
```

5. **If someone is kind then they eat the lion.**

```python
# Formula: If someone is kind then they eat the lion.
stmt5 = solver.mkImplication(
    solver.mkTerm(solver.APPLY_UF, is_kind, x),
    solver.mkTerm(solver.APPLY_UF, eats, x, lion)
)
```

6. **If someone sees the bald eagle then the bald eagle sees the cat.**

```python
# Formula: If someone sees the bald eagle then the bald eagle sees the cat.
stmt6 = solver.mkImplication(
    solver.mkTerm(solver.APPLY_UF, sees, x, bald_eagle),
    solver.mkTerm(solver.APPLY_UF, sees, bald_eagle, cat)
)
```

7. **The bald eagle is cold.**

```python
# Formula: The bald eagle is cold.
stmt7 = solver.mkTerm(solver.APPLY_UF, is_cold, bald_eagle)
```

8. **The bald eagle is round.**

```python
# Formula: The bald eagle is round.
stmt8 = solver.mkTerm(solver.APPLY_UF, is_round, bald_eagle)
```

9. **The bald eagle is young.**

```python
# Formula: The bald eagle is young.
stmt9 = solver.mkTerm(solver.APPLY_UF, is_young, bald_eagle)
```

10. **The bald eagle sees the lion.**

```python
# Formula: The bald eagle sees the lion.
stmt10 = solver.mkTerm(solver.APPLY_UF, sees, bald_eagle, lion)
```

11. **The cat is blue.**

```python
# Formula: The cat is blue.
stmt11 = solver.mkTerm(solver.APPLY_UF, is_blue, cat)
```

12. **The cow eats the lion.**

```python
# Formula: The cow eats the lion.
stmt12 = solver.mkTerm(solver.APPLY_UF, eats, cow, lion)
```

13. **The cow sees the cat.**

```python
# Formula: The cow sees the cat.
stmt13 = solver.mkTerm(solver.APPLY_UF, sees, cow, cat)
```

14. **The cow sees the lion.**

```python
# Formula: The cow sees the lion.
stmt14 = solver.mkTerm(solver.APPLY_UF, sees, cow, lion)
```

15. **The lion eats the cat.**

```python
# Formula: The lion eats the cat.
stmt15 = solver.mkTerm(solver.APPLY_UF, eats, lion, cat)
```

16. **The lion eats the cow.**

```python
# Formula: The lion eats the cow.
stmt16 = solver.mkTerm(solver.APPLY_UF, eats, lion, cow)
```

17. **The lion is cold.**

```python
# Formula: The lion is cold.
stmt17 = solver.mkTerm(solver.APPLY_UF, is_cold, lion)
```

### Test Statement Translation:
**The bald eagle sees the bald eagle.**

```python
# Formula: The bald eagle sees the bald eagle.
test_stmt = solver.mkTerm(solver.APPLY_UF, sees, bald_eagle, bald_eagle)
```

After defining all these, you can run the script to check whether the test statement "The bald eagle sees the bald eagle." is satisfied given the provided contextual statements. Make sure you have the necessary Python package `cvc5` installed. You can install it via pip:

```bash
pip install cvc5
