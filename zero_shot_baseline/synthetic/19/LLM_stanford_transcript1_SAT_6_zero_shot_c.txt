==========================================Based on Emily Ann Berkowitz's transcript, here are the analyses for both the BS and MS program requirements in Computer Science:

### BS Computer Science Program Requirements Analysis
#### Core Requirements:
1. **CS106B Programming Abstractions**: Completed with a grade of B.
2. **CS107 Computer Organization and Systems**: Completed CS107E with a grade of A.
3. **CS110 Principles of Computer Systems** (formerly CS111): Completed with a grade of A.
4. **CS103 Mathematical Foundations of Computing**: Not explicitly listed but probably satisfied by a combination of other math courses.
5. **CS109 Introduction to Probability for Computer Scientists**: Completed with a grade of B+.
6. **CS161 Design and Analysis of Algorithms**: Completed with a grade of B+.

#### Senior Project Requirement:
1. **CS191W Independent Project Writing Intensive**: Completed with a grade of A.

#### AI Elective Requirements:
1. **Core (15 units minimum):**
   - **CS107**: Completed (CS107E) with a grade of A.
   - **CS111/CS110**: Completed with a grade of A.
   - **CS161**: Completed with a grade of B+.

2. **Depth, Track, and Electives (25 units and seven courses minimum):**
   - **CS221 AI: Principles and Techniques**: Completed with a grade of A.
   - **Track Requirement B (two courses from different areas)**: 
     - **CS234, CS238, CS229**: Completed CS229 (Machine Learning) with a grade of A-.
     - **CS224N**: Completed with a grade of A.
     - **CS237A**: Completed with a grade of A.
   - **Track Requirement C**:
     - **CS228**: Completed with a grade of B+.
     - **CS233**: Completed with a grade of A-.
   - **Electives**:
     - **Three additional courses**: Completed relevant electives (listed in the transcript, e.g., CS131, CS225A).

#### Math and Science Requirements:
- **Math:** Sufficient units from courses like CME100, CME102, CME104, CME106, and CS109.
- **Science:** Physics series (PHYS41, PHYS43), additional courses such as EE courses, and PHYS70.

The student fulfills all the requirements for the BS degree in Computer Science.

**BS SAT**

### MS Specialization in Artificial Intelligence Program Requirements Analysis
#### Foundations Requirement:
1. **CS103 Logic, Automata & Complexity**: 
   - Satisfied by undergraduate coursework, likely from CS103 or related courses.
2. **Probability (CS109, Stat116, CME106, etc.)**: 
   - Satisfied with CS109 completed during undergraduate with a grade of B+.
3. **Algorithmic Analysis (CS161)**: 
   - Completed with a grade of B+.
4. **Computer Org & Sys (CS107 or 107E)**:
   - Completed (CS107E) with a grade of A.
5. **Principles of Computer Systems (CS111)**:
   - Satisfied by CS110 with a grade of A.

#### Significant Implementation Requirement:
- Relevant course examples: CS248.
- **CS248 Interactive Computer Graphics**: Completed with a grade of B+.

#### Breadth Requirement:
1. **Area A (Mathematical and Theoretical Foundations)**: 
   - **CS229 Machine Learning**: Completed with a grade of A-.
2. **Area B (Computer Systems)**: 
   - Not explicitly listed.
3. **Area C (Applications)**: 
   - Several courses such as CS131, CS224N, CS237A.
4. **Area D (Computing and Society)**: 
   - Not explicitly listed.

#### Depth Requirement:
1. **CS221**: Completed with a grade of A.
2. **Four courses from the list**:
   - **CS223A**: Completed with grade A-.
   - **CS224N**: Completed with grade A.
   - **CS228**: Completed with grade B+.
   - **CS229**: Completed with grade A-.
   - Additional courses: CS231N, CS233, CS237A, CS294

#### Electives:
- Additional required units from relevant courses and from the depth list (not explicitly listed in the transcript).

Since certain Depth and Breadth courses' explicit grading and listing are presently not fully outlined and without knowing if additional required breadth and elective courses have been met, a precise finalization is pending. However, the majority of the courses appear met.

**If all specific Breadth and Elective courses are satisfied, the output would then be:**

**MS SAT**

If any remain outstanding, please list the specific missed requirements per the MS specialization further needing review per the above requirements.
