==========================================Based on the given transcript and the specified requirements for the BS and MS in Computer Science with an Artificial Intelligence Specialization, I have conducted a detailed review to determine if Jane Doe satisfies all the requirements for both degrees.

### BS in Computer Science Degree Requirements Analysis

#### Core Requirements
1. **CS 103** (Mathematical Foundations of Computing): Not listed in the transcript.
2. **CS 106B** (Programming Abstractions): Completed with a grade of C+ for 6 units.
3. **CS 107** (Computer Organization and Systems): Completed with a grade of B.
4. **CS 109** (Introduction to Probability for Computer Scientists): Completed with a grade of C.
5. **CS 111** (Operating Systems Principles): Completed with a grade of C.
6. **CS 161** (Design and Analysis of Algorithms): Completed with a grade of C.

#### Math Requirements
1. **Calculus Sequence** (MATH 19, 20, 21): Jane completed MATH 19 and 20; MATH 21 is not listed.
2. **Probability Course**: STAT 116 completed with a grade of B.
3. Additional Math Electives: No clear elective math courses are listed beyond the required MATH and core courses.

#### Science Requirements
1. **PHYS 41** (Mechanics): Not listed.
2. **PHYS 43** (Electricity and Magnetism): Not listed.
3. **Science Elective**: BIO 42, BIO 82, BIO 130, CHEM 31A, BIO 151 (various grades ranging from A- to B-).

#### Engineering Fundamentals
1. **ENGR Requirement**: ENGR 50 was completed with a grade of B+.

#### Senior Project Requirement
1. **Senior Project (CS 210B)**: Completed with a grade of B+.

### BS Degree Summary
- **Mathematical Foundations of Computing (CS 103)**: Not completed.
- **One Calculus Course (MATH 21)**: Not completed.
- **Physics Sequence**: Not completed.

**Conclusion**: Due to the absence of completed courses for MATH 21, CS 103, and the required Physics sequence, the BS requirements are **not satisfied**.

**Output**: 
```
BS NOT SAT
Missing: MATH 21, CS 103, PHYS 41, PHYS 43
```

### MS in Computer Science: Artificial Intelligence Specialization Requirements Analysis

#### Foundations Requirement
1. **Logic, Automata & Complexity**: CS 103: Not completed.
2. **Probability**: STAT 116 completed.
3. **Algorithmic Analysis**: CS 161 completed.
4. **Computer Organization & Systems**: CS 107 completed.
5. **Principles of Computer Systems (CS 110/111)**: CS 111 completed.

#### Significant Implementation Requirement
- CS 210B (Software Engineering) satisfies the requirement.

#### Breadth Requirement
1. **Area A (Mathematical and Theoretical Foundations)**: No qualifying courses listed for MS.
2. **Area B (Computer Systems)**: CS 140 in ongoing term.
3. **Area C (Applications)**: CS 231A completed with a C+.
4. **Area D (Computing and Society)**: Not listed.

#### AI Depth Requirement
- **CS 221** is not explicitly listed but CS 271 (Artificial Intelligence) with grade C may be considered for AI principles.
- Depth options like CS 231A (completed), CS 234 (Reinforcement Learning C-). Other depth courses specified: CS 225A, CS 348K.

#### Electives
- Depth/Elective courses taken include CS 348K, CS 271, CS 234, CS 210B.

### MS Degree Summary
- **Breadth courses** are partially unlisted.
- **CS 103 (Logic) not completed**.
- AI Depth requirement needs review but generally fulfilled.

**Conclusion**: Due to missing courses in the foundations breadth category and incompletely listed depth/electives, the MS requirements are **not fully satisfied**.

**Output**:
```
MS NOT SAT
Missing: Logic Automata & Complexity (CS 103), Depth/Breadth courses review needed.
```

**General Conclusion**: Jane Doe does not currently meet all the requirements for either the BS or the MS degree based on the provided information.
