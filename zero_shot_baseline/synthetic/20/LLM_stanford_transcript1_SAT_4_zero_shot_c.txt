#### Significant Implementation Requirement
Courses to fulfill the significant implementation requirement need to be verified under the implementation provided: E.g., **CS 229** counts.

#### Breadth Requirement:
Must choose courses from three different breadth areas. Needs specific check if these fit in the Program.

Area A:
- Potential options need checking if chosen (CS 168, 261 might fit)

Area B:
- One selected (CS 140, 144 might fit)

Area C:
- Chosen (CS 229, 231N, Advanced chosen like CS 343 fit)

Area D:
- Courses such as CS 181, 182 are intended to fit here. Final review needed.
