course_units = To extract and format the course units from the document as a Python list, I'll go through the Mathematics and Science requirement section and list the relevant courses and their corresponding units. Note that the document specifies that all Mathematics and Science courses must sum up to a minimum of 37 units combined.

However, the document does not provide specific units for every course but gives hints like "MATH 19/20/21 or equivalent (10 units AP BC, or transfer)" which implies that MATH19, MATH20, and MATH21 combined are worth 10 units.

Given these hints, I will format the courses as lists of variables that hold the unit values. Here is the Python list representing the units for the Mathematics and Science requirement:

```python
[
    math19_units,      # MATH19
    math20_units,      # MATH20
    math21_units,      # MATH21
    cs103_units,       # CS103
    cs109_units,       # CS109
    math51_units,      # MATH51
    math52_units,      # MATH52
    math53_units,      # MATH53
    math104_units,     # MATH104
    math107_units,     # MATH107
    math108_units,     # MATH108
    math109_units,     # MATH109
    math110_units,     # MATH110
    math113_units,     # MATH113
    cs157_units,       # CS157
    cs205l_units,      # CS205L
    phil151_units,     # PHIL151
    cme100_units,      # CME100
    cme102_units,      # CME102
    cme104_units,      # CME104
    engr108_units,     # ENGR108
    phys41_units,      # PHYS41
    phys21_units,      # PHYS21
    phys61_units,      # PHYS61
    phys43_units,      # PHYS43
    phys23_units,      # PHYS23
    phys81_units,      # PHYS81
    phys63_units,      # PHYS63
    psych30_units,     # PSYCH30
    ap_chemistry_units # AP Chemistry

```

Remember to replace `math19_units`, `math20_units`, etc., with the actual unit values when known or provided. This list organizes the required and elective courses from the document based on the Mathematics and Science requirements specified.
