First, let's set up the initial formulas based on the given statements:

### Contextual Statements:

1. **If the cow needs the mouse and the mouse sees the cow then the mouse needs the cow.**

   ```
   # (cow_needs_mouse & mouse_sees_cow) -> mouse_needs_cow
   solver.assertFormula(Implies(And(cow_needs_mouse, mouse_sees_cow), mouse_needs_cow))
   ```

2. **If something visits the tiger and it visits the cow then it sees the mouse.**

   ```
   # forall x. (x_visits_tiger & x_visits_cow) -> x_sees_mouse
   x = solver.mkConst(x_type, "x")
   solver.assertFormula(Forall([x], Implies(And(x_visits_tiger(x), x_visits_cow(x)), x_sees_mouse(x))))
   ```

3. **If the mouse is rough and the mouse is red then the mouse visits the cat.**

   ```
   # (mouse_rough & mouse_red) -> mouse_visits_cat
   solver.assertFormula(Implies(And(mouse_rough, mouse_red), mouse_visits_cat))
   ```

4. **If something needs the mouse then it visits the tiger.**

   ```
   # forall x. x_needs_mouse -> x_visits_tiger
   solver.assertFormula(Forall([x], Implies(x_needs_mouse(x), x_visits_tiger(x))))
   ```

5. **If something needs the mouse then the mouse sees the cat.**

   ```
   # forall x. x_needs_mouse -> mouse_sees_cat
   solver.assertFormula(Forall([x], Implies(x_needs_mouse(x), mouse_sees_cat)))
   ```

6. **If something sees the cow and the cow needs the tiger then the cow needs the mouse.**

   ```
   # forall x. (x_sees_cow & cow_needs_tiger) -> cow_needs_mouse
   solver.assertFormula(Forall([x], Implies(And(x_sees_cow(x), cow_needs_tiger), cow_needs_mouse)))
   ```

7. **If something sees the cat then it sees the cow.**

   ```
   # forall x. x_sees_cat -> x_sees_cow
   solver.assertFormula(Forall([x], Implies(x_sees_cat(x), x_sees_cow(x))))
   ```

8. **If something is blue and green then it sees the mouse.**

   ```
   # forall x. (x_blue & x_green) -> x_sees_mouse
   solver.assertFormula(Forall([x], Implies(And(x_blue(x), x_green(x)), x_sees_mouse(x))))
   ```

9. **If something needs the cow then it visits the tiger.**

   ```
   # forall x. x_needs_cow -> x_visits_tiger
   solver.assertFormula(Forall([x], Implies(x_needs_cow(x), x_visits_tiger(x))))
   ```

10. **The cat is blue.**

    ```
    # cat_blue
    solver.assertFormula(cat_blue)
    ```

11. **The cat is rough.**

    ```
    # cat_rough
    solver.assertFormula(cat_rough)
    ```

12. **The cat sees the tiger.**

    ```
    # cat_sees_tiger
    solver.assertFormula(cat_sees_tiger)
    ```

13. **The cow needs the mouse.**

    ```
    # cow_needs_mouse
    solver.assertFormula(cow_needs_mouse)
    ```

14. **The cow sees the tiger.**

    ```
    # cow_sees_tiger
    solver.assertFormula(cow_sees_tiger)
    ```

15. **The cow visits the mouse.**

    ```
    # cow_visits_mouse
    solver.assertFormula(cow_visits_mouse)
    ```

16. **The cow visits the tiger.**

    ```
    # cow_visits_tiger
    solver.assertFormula(cow_visits_tiger)
    ```

17. **The mouse is green.**

    ```
    # mouse_green
    solver.assertFormula(mouse_green)
    ```

18. **The mouse is rough.**

    ```
    # mouse_rough
    solver.assertFormula(mouse_rough)
    ```

19. **The mouse visits the cow.**

    ```
    # mouse_visits_cow
    solver.assertFormula(mouse_visits_cow)
    ```

20. **The tiger needs the mouse.**

    ```
    # tiger_needs_mouse
    solver.assertFormula(tiger_needs_mouse)
    ```

### Test Statement:

**The mouse sees the mouse.**

```
# Test statement: mouse_sees_mouse
result = solver.checkSatAssuming(mouse_sees_mouse)
print(result)
```
