        Your task is to generate cvc5 python solver formulas for the constraints in each requirement FOUNDATIONS REQUIREMENT: You must satisfy the requirements listed in each of the following areas; all courses taken elsewhere must be approved by your adviser via the foundation course waiver form. Do not enter anything in the “Units” column for courses taken elsewhere or for Stanford courses counted towards your undergraduate degree.

        When generating cvc5 solver formulas, please instantiate new variables to check the transcript schema against each constraint in the FOUNDATIONS REQUIERMENT. You should also include
        solver formulas for advisor approval and deviation constraints if there is one. Please generate
        formulas with respect to the requirements only.

```

This code snippet generates a cvc5 solver to check the constraints in the Foundations Requirement for the given transcript schema. The constraints include:

1. Specific course constraints for the required subjects.
2. Approval constraints based on the advisor's approval.
3. Total units constraint which should not exceed 10 units.

You can tailor the example input transcript to your actual data and run the solver to check if the constraints are satisfied.
