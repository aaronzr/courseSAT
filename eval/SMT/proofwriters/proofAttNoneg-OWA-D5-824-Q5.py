Let's translate each sentence into CVC5 SMT python formulas. We will use the CVC5 API for Python to construct our logical formulas. Here are translations of the sentences:

1. Cold people are red.
2. If someone is young and cold then they are smart.
3. All young people are nice.
4. All nice, young people are kind.
5. All nice people are cold.
6. If someone is smart then they are young.
7. Young, kind people are smart.
8. All cold, red people are big.
9. Red, smart people are young.
10. Anne is smart.
11. Charlie is cold.
12. Charlie is kind.
13. Charlie is nice.
14. Charlie is red.
15. Dave is big.
16. Dave is cold.
17. Dave is kind.
18. Dave is red.
19. Dave is smart.
20. Dave is young.
21. Gary is nice.
22. Gary is red.
23. Gary is smart.

Test Statement:
- Gary is big.

Below is the corresponding CVC5 python code:

```python
import cvc5
from cvc5 import Kind

solver = cvc5.Solver()
solver.setLogic('QF_UF')

# Define sorts
Person = solver.getUninterpretedSort('Person')

# Define people
Anne = solver.mkConst(Person, 'Anne')
Charlie = solver.mkConst(Person, 'Charlie')
Dave = solver.mkConst(Person, 'Dave')
Gary = solver.mkConst(Person, 'Gary')

# Define predicates
Cold = solver.mkPredicate(Person, 'Cold')
Red = solver.mkPredicate(Person, 'Red')
Young = solver.mkPredicate(Person, 'Young')
Smart = solver.mkPredicate(Person, 'Smart')
Nice = solver.mkPredicate(Person, 'Nice')
Kind = solver.mkPredicate(Person, 'Kind')
Big = solver.mkPredicate(Person, 'Big')

# Add the contextual formulas
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkForall([Anne], solver.mkImplies(Cold(Anne), Red(Anne))))  # Cold people are red.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkForall([Anne], solver.mkImplies(solver.mkAnd(Young(Anne), Cold(Anne)), Smart(Anne))))  # If someone is young and cold then they are smart.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkForall([Anne], solver.mkImplies(Young(Anne), Nice(Anne))))  # All young people are nice.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkForall([Anne], solver.mkImplies(solver.mkAnd(Nice(Anne), Young(Anne)), Kind(Anne))))  # All nice, young people are kind.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkForall([Anne], solver.mkImplies(Nice(Anne), Cold(Anne))))  # All nice people are cold.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkForall([Anne], solver.mkImplies(Smart(Anne), Young(Anne))))  # If someone is smart then they are young.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkForall([Anne], solver.mkImplies(solver.mkAnd(Young(Anne), Kind(Anne)), Smart(Anne))))  # Young, kind people are smart.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkForall([Anne], solver.mkImplies(solver.mkAnd(Cold(Anne), Red(Anne)), Big(Anne))))  # All cold, red people are big.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkForall([Anne], solver.mkImplies(solver.mkAnd(Red(Anne), Smart(Anne)), Young(Anne))))  # Red, smart people are young.

# Specific conditions for individuals
solver.assertFormula(Smart(Anne))  # Anne is smart.
solver.assertFormula(Cold(Charlie))  # Charlie is cold.
solver.assertFormula(Kind(Charlie))  # Charlie is kind.
solver.assertFormula(Nice(Charlie))  # Charlie is nice.
solver.assertFormula(Red(Charlie))  # Charlie is red.
solver.assertFormula(Big(Dave))  # Dave is big.
solver.assertFormula(Cold(Dave))  # Dave is cold.
solver.assertFormula(Kind(Dave))  # Dave is kind.
solver.assertFormula(Red(Dave))  # Dave is red.
solver.assertFormula(Smart(Dave))  # Dave is smart.
solver.assertFormula(Young(Dave))  # Dave is young.
solver.assertFormula(Nice(Gary))  # Gary is nice.
solver.assertFormula(Red(Gary))  # Gary is red.
solver.assertFormula(Smart(Gary))  # Gary is smart.

# Test statement
test_stmt = Big(Gary)  # Gary is big.

# Check the satisfiability of the test statement
result = solver.checkSatAssuming(test_stmt)
print(result)
```
This code sets up the solver, defines the people and the predicates (Cold, Red, Young, Smart, Nice, Kind, Big), and asserts the given contextual statements. Finally, it checks whether "Gary is big" is satisfiable given the contextual statements.
