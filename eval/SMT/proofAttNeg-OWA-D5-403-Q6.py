The parameters we're dealing with include individuals (e.g., Anne, Bob, Dave, and Gary) and properties (e.g., big, round, red, green, furry, nice, and young).

First, let's set up the environment and declare the necessary parameters:

```python
import cvc5
from cvc5 import Kind

# Initialize the solver
solver = cvc5.Solver()

# Set the logic
solver.setOption("produce-models", "true")

# Declare sorts for individuals and booleans
Individual = solver.getIntegerSort()
Bool = solver.getBooleanSort()

# Declare individuals
Anne = solver.mkConst(Individual, 'Anne')
Bob = solver.mkConst(Individual, 'Bob')
Dave = solver.mkConst(Individual, 'Dave')
Gary = solver.mkConst(Individual, 'Gary')

# Declare properties as functions
big = solver.mkFunction(Individual, Bool, "big")
round = solver.mkFunction(Individual, Bool, "round")
red = solver.mkFunction(Individual, Bool, "red")
green = solver.mkFunction(Individual, Bool, "green")
furry = solver.mkFunction(Individual, Bool, "furry")
nice = solver.mkFunction(Individual, Bool, "nice")
young = solver.mkFunction(Individual, Bool, "young")
```

Now, we will translate each of the given statements into a CVC5 formula:

### Contextual Statements:

1. **All round people are big.**
    ```python
    x = solver.mkVar(Individual, "x")
    stmt_1 = solver.mkForall(x, solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(round, x), solver.mkTerm(big, x)))
    solver.assertFormula(stmt_1)
    ```

2. **If someone is red and green then they are big.**
    ```python
    stmt_2 = solver.mkForall(x, solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES,
                                              solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, solver.mkTerm(red, x), solver.mkTerm(green, x)),
                                              solver.mkTerm(big, x)))
    solver.assertFormula(stmt_2)
    ```

3. **Green people are not furry.**
    ```python
    stmt_3 = solver.mkForall(x, solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(green, x), solver.mkTerm(Kind.NOT, solver.mkTerm(furry, x))))
    solver.assertFormula(stmt_3)
    ```

4. **All nice, red people are not green.**
    ```python
    stmt_4 = solver.mkForall(x, solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES,
                                              solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, solver.mkTerm(nice, x), solver.mkTerm(red, x)),
                                              solver.mkTerm(Kind.NOT, solver.mkTerm(green, x))))
    solver.assertFormula(stmt_4)
    ```

5. **If Bob is not nice then Bob is not green.**
    ```python
    stmt_5 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(Kind.NOT, solver.mkTerm(nice, Bob)), solver.mkTerm(Kind.NOT, solver.mkTerm(green, Bob)))
    solver.assertFormula(stmt_5)
    ```

6. **If someone is nice then they are round.**
    ```python
    stmt_6 = solver.mkForall(x, solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(nice, x), solver.mkTerm(round, x)))
    solver.assertFormula(stmt_6)
    ```

7. **If someone is round and not nice then they are red.**
    ```python
    stmt_7 = solver.mkForall(x, solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES,
                                              solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, solver.mkTerm(round, x), solver.mkTerm(Kind.NOT, solver.mkTerm(nice, x))),
                                              solver.mkTerm(red, x)))
    solver.assertFormula(stmt_7)
    ```

8. **If someone is big and nice then they are red.**
    ```python
    stmt_8 = solver.mkForall(x, solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES,
                                              solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, solver.mkTerm(big, x), solver.mkTerm(nice, x)),
                                              solver.mkTerm(red, x)))
    solver.assertFormula(stmt_8)
    ```

9. **If someone is red and not green then they are young.**
    ```python
    stmt_9 = solver.mkForall(x, solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES,
                                              solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, solver.mkTerm(red, x), solver.mkTerm(Kind.NOT, solver.mkTerm(green, x))),
                                              solver.mkTerm(young, x)))
    solver.assertFormula(stmt_9)
    ```

10. **Anne is big.**
    ```python
    stmt_10 = solver.mkTerm(big, Anne)
    solver.assertFormula(stmt_10)
    ```

11. **Anne is green.**
    ```python
    stmt_11 = solver.mkTerm(green, Anne)
    solver.assertFormula(stmt_11)
    ```

12. **Anne is red.**
    ```python
    stmt_12 = solver.mkTerm(red, Anne)
    solver.assertFormula(stmt_12)
    ```

13. **Anne is not young.**
    ```python
    stmt_13 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.NOT, solver.mkTerm(young, Anne))
    solver.assertFormula(stmt_13)
    ```

14. **Bob is nice.**
    ```python
    stmt_14 = solver.mkTerm(nice, Bob)
    solver.assertFormula(stmt_14)
    ```

15. **Dave is big.**
    ```python
    stmt_15 = solver.mkTerm(big, Dave)
    solver.assertFormula(stmt_15)
    ```

16. **Dave is green.**
    ```python
    stmt_16 = solver.mkTerm(green, Dave)
    solver.assertFormula(stmt_16)
    ```

17. **Dave is not nice.**
    ```python
    stmt_17 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.NOT, solver.mkTerm(nice, Dave))
    solver.assertFormula(stmt_17)
    ```

18. **Dave is red.**
    ```python
    stmt_18 = solver.mkTerm(red, Dave)
    solver.assertFormula(stmt_18)
    ```

19. **Gary is not young.**
    ```python
    stmt_19 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.NOT, solver.mkTerm(young, Gary))
    solver.assertFormula(stmt_19)
    ```

### Test Statement:

**Bob is not big.**
```python
test_stmt = solver.mkTerm(Kind.NOT, solver.mkTerm(big, Bob))
```

### Running the Solver

We need to check if the test statement is satisfied or not given the above context.

```python
# Assertion for the test statement
solver.push()
solver.assertFormula(test_stmt)
result = solver.checkSat()
if result.isUnsat():
    print("The test statement (Bob is not big) is unsatisfied.")
elif result.isSat():
    print("The test statement (Bob is not big) is satisfied.")
else:
    print("The satisfiability of the test statement could not be determined.")

solver.pop()
```

Now you can run the above code to evaluate whether the statement "Bob is not big" is satisfied or unsatisfied given the other contextual statements.
