Let's analyze Amanda Marie Johnson's transcript against the requirements provided for the BS in Computer Science and the MS in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence. 

### BS Requirements Analysis
#### Core Requirements:
1. **CS103**: Completed (Spring 2019, Grade: B+)
2. **CS106B**: Completed (Autumn 2019, Grade: C)
3. **CS107**: Completed (Autumn 2020, Grade: C)
4. **CS109**: Completed (Winter 2020, Grade: B+)
5. **CS111**: Not listed, but EE course substitutions may be considered based on deeper review.
6. **CS161**: Completed (Autumn 2020, Grade: D)

#### Grade Point Average:
- Amanda needs a minimum 2.0 GPA for all Engineering Fundamentals, Core, Depth, and Senior Project courses combined. There may be a GPA concern for some courses like CS106B (Grade: C) and CS161 (Grade: D). We'd need to calculate the specific GPA for these BS requirements to confirm this.

#### Senior Project:
- No specific course listed for CS194, CS210B, CS191/W, or CS294 from the transcript. We need a Senior Project course to be completed.

#### Mathematics:
1. **MATH 19**: Completed (Autumn 2018, Grade: B)
2. **MATH 20**: Completed (Winter 2019, Grade: C)
3. **MATH 21**: Completed (Spring 2019, Grade: B)
4. **CS103**: Completed (Spring 2019, Grade: B+)
5. **CS109**: Completed (Winter 2020, Grade: B+)
6. **STAT 110**: Completed (Winter 2020, Grade: B) (as one elective)

#### Science:
1. **PHYSICS 41**: Completed (Spring 2019, Grade: A-)
2. **PHYSICS 44**: Completed (Spring 2020, Grade: S)
3. **EE 43**: Completed (Spring 2020, Grade: A-)

#### Engineering Fundamentals:
- **CS106B**: Completed (Autumn 2019, Grade: C)
- **ENGR 40**: Completed (Autumn 2019, Grade: B+)

### Observation:
Amanda needs to improve her CS161 course grade and needs to complete a Senior Project to satisfy BS requirements.

**BS NOT SATISFIED:**
1. CS111
2. CS161 (Grade D, needs improvement)
3. Senior Project

---

### MS Requirements Analysis
#### Foundations Requirement:
1. **Logic, Automata & Complexity (CS103)**: Completed (BS)
2. **Probability (CS109)**: Completed (BS)
3. **Algorithmic Analysis (CS161)**: Completed (Grade: D, needs improvement)
4. **Computer Organ & Sys (CS107)**: Completed (BS)
5. **Principles of Computer Systems (CS111)**: Not completed by transcript data.

#### Significant Implementation Requirement:
- **CS 221**: Not listed, needs to be completed.

#### Breadth Requirement:
1. **Area A**: Not satisfied.
2. **Area B**: Not satisfied.
3. **Area C**: Satisfied with CS248.
4. **Area D**: Not satisfied.

#### Artificial Intelligence Depth:
- Needs specific courses focused on AI depth requirements which were not listed.

#### Electives:
- No electives listed under MS requirements (must review based on elective criteria).

### Observation:
Several AI specialization tasks and breadth requirements are left incomplete or missing grades.

**MS NOT SATISFIED:** 
1. CS111
2. CS161 (Grade D, needs retaking/improvement)
3. Significant Implementation Requirement (e.g., CS 221)
4. Breadth Requirement (Missing 2 Areas)
5. AI Depth Courses

Amanda has some BS and MS requirements still unsatisfied based on the provided transcript data. Adjustments in her course selections and improvements in specific grades are necessary.

**Action Required:**
Retake CS161 to achieve a better grade, take CS111, complete a Senior Project, and satisfy specific requirements for MS AI specialization including significant implementation and breadth areas.
