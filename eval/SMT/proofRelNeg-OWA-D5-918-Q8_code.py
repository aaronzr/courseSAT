Alright, let's carefully translate each contextual statement and the test statement into cvc5 python formulas.

We will use boolean variables to represent each of the predicates. Here's the plan for the predicates:
- `sees(X, Y)`: X sees Y
- `likes(X, Y)`: X likes Y
- `visits(X, Y)`: X visits Y
- `big(X)`: X is big
- `green(X)`: X is green
- `round(X)`: X is round
- `blue(X)`: X is blue
- `kind(X)`: X is kind

### Translating the Statements

#### Contextual Statements
1. `If something sees the cow then the cow is big.`
   ```python
   for X in entities:
       solver.assert_formula(solver.mkTerm(Implies, sees(X, cow), big(cow)))
   ```

2. `If something likes the cat then it visits the cat.`
   ```python
   for X in entities:
       solver.assert_formula(solver.mkTerm(Implies, likes(X, cat), visits(X, cat)))
   ```

3. `If something is big then it is green.`
   ```python
   for X in entities:
       solver.assert_formula(solver.mkTerm(Implies, big(X), green(X)))
   ```

4. `If the squirrel likes the rabbit and the squirrel likes the cow then the squirrel is round.`
   ```python
   solver.assert_formula(solver.mkTerm(Implies, solver.mkTerm(And, likes(squirrel, rabbit), likes(squirrel, cow)), round(squirrel)))
   ```

5. `If something is blue and it sees the cow then the cow is kind.`
   ```python
   for X in entities:
       solver.assert_formula(solver.mkTerm(Implies, solver.mkTerm(And, blue(X), sees(X, cow)), kind(cow)))
   ```

6. `If the cat is round and the cat likes the rabbit then the rabbit visits the cat.`
   ```python
   solver.assert_formula(solver.mkTerm(Implies, solver.mkTerm(And, round(cat), likes(cat, rabbit)), visits(rabbit, cat)))
   ```

7. `If something sees the cat then it is big.`
   ```python
   for X in entities:
       solver.assert_formula(solver.mkTerm(Implies, sees(X, cat), big(X)))
   ```

8. `If something is green then it sees the cow.`
   ```python
   for X in entities:
       solver.assert_formula(solver.mkTerm(Implies, green(X), sees(X, cow)))
   ```

9. `If the cow does not like the cat and the cat is not blue then the cat is not kind.`
   ```python
   solver.assert_formula(solver.mkTerm(Implies, solver.mkTerm(And, solver.mkTerm(Not, likes(cow, cat)), solver.mkTerm(Not, blue(cat))), solver.mkTerm(Not, kind(cat))))
   ```

10. `The cat visits the squirrel.`
    ```python
    solver.assert_formula(visits(cat, squirrel))
    ```

11. `The cow is not kind.`
    ```python
    solver.assert_formula(solver.mkTerm(Not, kind(cow)))
    ```

12. `The cow is round.`
    ```python
    solver.assert_formula(round(cow))
    ```

13. `The cow does not like the squirrel.`
    ```python
    solver.assert_formula(solver.mkTerm(Not, likes(cow, squirrel)))
    ```

14. `The cow sees the rabbit.`
    ```python
    solver.assert_formula(sees(cow, rabbit))
    ```

15. `The cow visits the cat.`
    ```python
    solver.assert_formula(visits(cow, cat))
    ```

16. `The rabbit is big.`
    ```python
    solver.assert_formula(big(rabbit))
    ```

17. `The rabbit likes the squirrel.`
    ```python
    solver.assert_formula(likes(rabbit, squirrel))
    ```

18. `The rabbit visits the cat.`
    ```python
    solver.assert_formula(visits(rabbit, cat))
    ```

19. `The squirrel is round.`
    ```python
    solver.assert_formula(round(squirrel))
    ```

20. `The squirrel likes the cow.`
    ```python
    solver.assert_formula(likes(squirrel, cow))
    ```

#### Test Statement
`The cow is not big.`
```python
test_statement = solver.mkTerm(Not, big(cow))
```

### Python Code to Implement the Logic Using cvc5 SMT Solver
Finally, bring everything together into a testable Python function using the CVC5 solver:

```python
import cvc5

solver = cvc5.Solver()

# Define our entities
entities = ['cow', 'cat', 'squirrel', 'rabbit']

# Create functions
sees = {}
likes = {}
visits = {}
big = {}
green = {}
round = {}
blue = {}
kind = {}

for entity in entities:
    sees[entity] = {target: solver.mkBoolTerm() for target in entities}
    likes[entity] = {target: solver.mkBoolTerm() for target in entities}
    visits[entity] = {target: solver.mkBoolTerm() for target in entities}
    big[entity] = solver.mkBoolTerm()
    green[entity] = solver.mkBoolTerm()
    round[entity] = solver.mkBoolTerm()
    blue[entity] = solver.mkBoolTerm()
    kind[entity] = solver.mkBoolTerm()

# Translate and add the statements to the solver
for X in entities:
    solver.assert_formula(solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.IMPLIES, sees[X]['cow'], big['cow']))
    solver.assert_formula(solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.IMPLIES, likes[X]['cat'], visits[X]['cat']))
    solver.assert_formula(solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.IMPLIES, big[X], green[X]))

solver.assert_formula(solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.AND, likes['squirrel']['rabbit'], likes['squirrel']['cow']), round['squirrel']))

for X in entities:
    solver.assert_formula(solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.AND, blue[X], sees[X]['cow']), kind['cow']))
    
solver.assert_formula(solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.AND, round['cat'], likes['cat']['rabbit']), visits['rabbit']['cat']))

for X in entities:
    solver.assert_formula(solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.IMPLIES, sees[X]['cat'], big[X]))
    solver.assert_formula(solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.IMPLIES, green[X], sees[X]['cow']))

solver.assert_formula(solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.AND, solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.NOT, likes['cow']['cat']), solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.NOT, blue['cat'])), solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.NOT, kind['cat'])))

solver.assert_formula(visits['cat']['squirrel'])
solver.assert_formula(solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.NOT, kind['cow']))
solver.assert_formula(round['cow'])
solver.assert_formula(solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.NOT, likes['cow']['squirrel']))
solver.assert_formula(sees['cow']['rabbit'])
solver.assert_formula(visits['cow']['cat'])
solver.assert_formula(big['rabbit'])
solver.assert_formula(likes['rabbit']['squirrel'])
solver.assert_formula(visits['rabbit']['cat'])
solver.assert_formula(round['squirrel'])
solver.assert_formula(likes['squirrel']['cow'])

# Test statement: The cow is not big
test_statement = solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.NOT, big['cow'])

# Check if the test statement is satisfied
result = solver.checkSatAssuming([test_statement])
if result.isSat():
    print("The test statement is satisfied.")
else:
    print("The test statement is not satisfied.")
```

This code will evaluate whether "The cow is not big" based on the given contextual statements and output whether the statement is satisfied or not.
