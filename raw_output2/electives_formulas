        Your task is to generate cvc5 python solver formulas for the constraints in each requirement ELECTIVES

List here any additional courses used to complete the 45-unit requirement for the MSCS degree. You may count up to a maximum of 3 units of 1-2 unit seminars offered in the School of Engineering. All other electives must be taken for 3 or more units. CS courses numbered above 111, excluding CS196, CS198, and CS390A/B/C, can be used as MS electives. Non-CS courses must be technical courses numbered above 100, related to the degree program, and approved by the adviser and the MS program administrator. Note that CS 129 may not be counted towards the MS if CS 229 is being counted towards any BS or MS requirement.

TOTAL UNITS APPLIED TO MSCS. Below is an example formula for a given requiremet: Students must take one of the courses in (CS 100, CS 101, CS 102)

        When generating parameterized cvc5 solver formulas, please instantiate new variables to check the transcript schema against each constraint in the ELECTIVES. You should also include
        solver formulas for advisor approval and deviation constraints if there is one. Please note that not all taken couses in the transcript satisfy the given requierments. Please generate
        parameterized formulas with respect to the requirements only. 
        =======================formula ouput===========================
To generate cvc5 solver formulas for the constraints in the ELECTIVES requirement, we need to ensure that courses listed under electives fulfill a set of specific rules. Let's break down the rules and convert each into a logical constraint:

1. **Total Units Constraint**:
   - Up to a maximum of 3 units of 1-2 unit seminars allowed.
   - All other electives must be 3 or more units.
   - Total elective units should be 45 units for graduation.

2. **Course Category Constraint**:
   - CS courses numbered above 111, excluding CS196, CS198, and CS390A/B/C, can be used.
   - Non-CS courses must be technical courses numbered above 100, approved by the adviser and the MS program administrator.
   - CS129 cannot be counted towards MS if CS229 is counted.

3. **Deviation Constraint**:
   - Any deviation from the allowed courses list must be approved by the advisor.

Given these constraints, let's build the cvc5 solver formulas. Here's how you can systematically generate parameterized cvc5 formulas for verifying the transcript schema:

```python
from cvc5 import Solver, Kind

solver = Solver()
solver.setLogic("QF_LIA")  # Quantifier-Free Linear Integer Arithmetic Logic

# Define transcript schema input variables
total_units = solver.mkConst(solver.getIntegerSort(), "total_units")
cumulative_gpa_undergrad = solver.mkConst(solver.getRealSort(), "cumulative_gpa_undergrad")
cumulative_gpa_graduate = solver.mkConst(solver.getRealSort(), "cumulative_gpa_graduate")

# Load the transcript schema (example)
transcript = {
    "Student": {
        "Name": "John Doe",
        "Program": "MSCS",
        "StudentID": 12345678,
        "Coterm": False
    },
    "AP_Credits": [
        {"Advanced_Placement": "Math", "Earned_Units": 10}
    ],
    "Courses_Taken": [
        {"Course_ID": 123, "Title": "CS 221", "Earned_Units": 3, "Grade": "A"},
        {"Course_ID": 124, "Title": "CS 229", "Earned_Units": 3, "Grade": "B"},
        {"Course_ID": 125, "Title": "EE 276", "Earned_Units": 3, "Grade": "A"}
    ],
    "Deviations": [
        {"Deviated_Course_ID": "EE 276", "Approved": True, "Approved_By": "Advisor Name"}
    ],
    "Approval": [
        {"Approved": True, "Approved_By": "MS Program Administrator", "Approved_Course_ID": "EE 276"}
    ],
    "Cumulative_GPA": {
        "Undergrad": 3.5,
        "Graduate": 3.8
    }
}

# Define constants for categories and other conditions
MAX_SEMINAR_UNITS = 3
MAX_TOTAL_UNITS = 45
MIN_COURSE_NUMBER = 111
SEMINAR_UNIT_LIMIT = 2

# Initialize helper variables
total_elective_units = solver.mkConst(solver.getIntegerSort(), "total_elective_units")
total_seminar_units = solver.mkConst(solver.getIntegerSort(), "total_seminar_units")

    else:

    # CS courses condition
    if title.startswith("CS") and int(title.split(" ")[1]) > MIN_COURSE_NUMBER and title not in ["CS196", "CS198", "CS390A", "CS390B", "CS390C"]:
        pass # valid course to be considered

    # Non-CS technical courses must be above 100, and approved
    if not title.startswith("CS") and int(title.split(" ")[1]) > 100:
        approval_constraints = [solver.mkBoolConst("approved_{}".format(course_id))]
        for approval in transcript["Approval"]:
            if approval["Approved"] and approval["Approved_Course_ID"] == title:
                approval_constraints.append(solver.mkBool(True))

        course_constraints.append(solver.mkTerm(Kind.OR, *approval_constraints))

# Helper constraints
course_constraints.append(solver.mkTerm(Kind.LEQ, total_seminar_units, solver.mkInteger(MAX_SEMINAR_UNITS)))
course_constraints.append(solver.mkTerm(Kind.LEQ, solver.mkInteger(int(sum(c['Earned_Units'] for c in transcript['Courses_Taken']))), solver.mkInteger(MAX_TOTAL_UNITS)))

# Total units must equal to 45
course_constraints.append(solver.mkTerm(Kind.EQUAL, total_elective_units, solver.mkInteger(MAX_TOTAL_UNITS)))

# Combine all constraints 
final_formula = solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, *course_constraints)

# Assert the final formula
solver.assertFormula(final_formula)

# Check the satisfiability
if solver.checkSat().isSat():
    print("The transcript satisfies all ELECTIVES requirements.")
else:
    print("The transcript does not satisfy the ELECTIVES requirements.")
```

This script converts the given ELECTIVES constraints for the MSCS program into a logical form using the cvc5 solver. It checks the constraints for overall units, specific course requirements, and deviation approvals. The logical assertions cover units for seminars, specific valid courses, and the necessity for approved deviations.

Please adjust the input transcript as per actual use cases and ensure the cvc5 Python API is correctly set up in your environment to execute the script.
