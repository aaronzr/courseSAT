To translate the given natural language statements into CVC5 SMT formulas in Python, we'll use the CVC5 library. The syntax and logic will be carefully constructed sentence by sentence. Let's get started:

### Step-by-Step Translation

1. **Initializing the Solver & Definitions**
    ```python
    import cvc5
    from cvc5.pythonic import *

    solver = Solver()

    # Define sorts
    Animal = solver.getSort('Animal')

    # Define predicates
    is_big = solver.defineFun("is_big", Animal, bool)
    chases = solver.defineFun("chases", Animal, Animal, bool)
    eats = solver.defineFun("eats", Animal, Animal, bool)
    likes = solver.defineFun("likes", Animal, Animal, bool)
    is_round = solver.defineFun("is_round", Animal, bool)
    is_red = solver.defineFun("is_red", Animal, bool)

    # Define constants for the animals
    bear = solver.defineConst('bear', Animal)
    bald_eagle = solver.defineConst('bald_eagle', Animal)
    mouse = solver.defineConst('mouse', Animal)
    squirrel = solver.defineConst('squirrel', Animal)
    ```

2. **Translate Statements into Formulas**

    ```python
    # 1. If something is big and it chases the bald eagle then it eats the bear.
    x = solver.defineConst('x', Animal)
    solver.addFormula(is_big(x) & chases(x, bald_eagle) >> eats(x, bear))

    # 2. If something eats the mouse then the mouse likes the squirrel.
    solver.addFormula(eats(x, mouse) >> likes(mouse, squirrel))

    # 3. If something likes the squirrel then it is round.
    solver.addFormula(likes(x, squirrel) >> is_round(x))

    # 4. If the bear eats the squirrel and the squirrel chases the mouse then the squirrel does not like the bald eagle.
    solver.addFormula(eats(bear, squirrel) & chases(squirrel, mouse) >> ~likes(squirrel, bald_eagle))

    # 5. If something is round then it chases the bald eagle.
    solver.addFormula(is_round(x) >> chases(x, bald_eagle))

    # 6. If something likes the squirrel and the squirrel eats the bald eagle then the bald eagle chases the squirrel.
    solver.addFormula(likes(x, squirrel) & eats(squirrel, bald_eagle) >> chases(bald_eagle, squirrel))

    # 7. If something eats the mouse and the mouse chases the bear then it eats the bald eagle.
    solver.addFormula(eats(x, mouse) & chases(mouse, bear) >> eats(x, bald_eagle))

    # 8. If something eats the bear and it likes the bald eagle then it eats the mouse.
    solver.addFormula(eats(x, bear) & likes(x, bald_eagle) >> eats(x, mouse))

    # 9. The bald eagle does not eat the bear.
    solver.addFormula(~eats(bald_eagle, bear))

    # 10. The bald eagle is not red.
    solver.addFormula(~is_red(bald_eagle))

    # 11. The bear is big.
    solver.addFormula(is_big(bear))

    # 12. The bear is young.
    # There is no young predicate, so instead we'll indicate a fact without needing to analyze it later.
    # solver.addFormula(is_young(bear))

    # 13. The bear likes the bald eagle.
    solver.addFormula(likes(bear, bald_eagle))

    # 14. The bear likes the squirrel.
    solver.addFormula(likes(bear, squirrel))

    # 15. The mouse chases the bear.
    solver.addFormula(chases(mouse, bear))

    # 16. The mouse is big.
    solver.addFormula(is_big(mouse))

    # 17. The squirrel does not chase the mouse.
    solver.addFormula(~chases(squirrel, mouse))

    # 18. The squirrel is big.
    solver.addFormula(is_big(squirrel))
    ```

3. **Test Statement**

    ```python
    # Test Statement: The bear does not eat the mouse
    test_result = solver.checkSatAssuming(~eats(bear, mouse))
    print("Test Result:", test_result)  # Expected to be "SAT" or "UNSAT"
    ```

### Complete Code
Here is the complete code in one block for clarity:
```python
import cvc5
from cvc5.pythonic import *

solver = Solver()

# Define sorts
Animal = solver.getSort('Animal')

# Define predicates
is_big = solver.defineFun("is_big", Animal, bool)
chases = solver.defineFun("chases", Animal, Animal, bool)
eats = solver.defineFun("eats", Animal, Animal, bool)
likes = solver.defineFun("likes", Animal, Animal, bool)
is_round = solver.defineFun("is_round", Animal, bool)
is_red = solver.defineFun("is_red", Animal, bool)

# Define constants for the animals
bear = solver.defineConst('bear', Animal)
bald_eagle = solver.defineConst('bald_eagle', Animal)
mouse = solver.defineConst('mouse', Animal)
squirrel = solver.defineConst('squirrel', Animal)

# Translate statements
x = solver.defineConst('x', Animal)
solver.addFormula(is_big(x) & chases(x, bald_eagle) >> eats(x, bear))
solver.addFormula(eats(x, mouse) >> likes(mouse, squirrel))
solver.addFormula(likes(x, squirrel) >> is_round(x))
solver.addFormula(eats(bear, squirrel) & chases(squirrel, mouse) >> ~likes(squirrel, bald_eagle))
solver.addFormula(is_round(x) >> chases(x, bald_eagle))
solver.addFormula(likes(x, squirrel) & eats(squirrel, bald_eagle) >> chases(bald_eagle, squirrel))
solver.addFormula(eats(x, mouse) & chases(mouse, bear) >> eats(x, bald_eagle))
solver.addFormula(eats(x, bear) & likes(x, bald_eagle) >> eats(x, mouse))
solver.addFormula(~eats(bald_eagle, bear))
solver.addFormula(~is_red(bald_eagle))
solver.addFormula(is_big(bear))
solver.addFormula(likes(bear, bald_eagle))
solver.addFormula(likes(bear, squirrel))
solver.addFormula(chases(mouse, bear))
solver.addFormula(is_big(mouse))
solver.addFormula(~chases(squirrel, mouse))
solver.addFormula(is_big(squirrel))

# Test Statement: The bear does not eat the mouse
test_result = solver.checkSatAssuming(~eats(bear, mouse))
print("Test Result:", test_result)  # Expected to be "SAT" or "UNSAT"
```

Ensure that the CVC5 library is correctly installed in your Python environment to execute the code. This code checks if the statement "The bear does not eat the mouse" is satisfied based on the given contextual statements.
