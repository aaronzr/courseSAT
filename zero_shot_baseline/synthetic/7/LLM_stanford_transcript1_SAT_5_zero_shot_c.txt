- **All previously mentioned depth courses satisfying electives.**

**Additional Requirements Completion:**
- All courses numbered 100 or greater.
- Over 36 units taken for a grade.
- Entire undergraduate allotment accomplished excluding doubly-counted courses.

**Evaluation:**
Emily Grace Johnson has satisfied most MSCS AI specialization requirements considering overlap acceptance rules. Minor Breadth deviations such as Breadth A and Breadth Area B need to be confirmed for course equivalencies or approved by adviser.

**Output:**
There are minor deviations in the exact Breadth requirements. Pending formal adviser approval for Breadth areas A and B (or alternative course selections), Emily Grace Johnson’s current transcript suggests near-satisfaction of MSCS requirements.

**Potential deficiencies**: Breadth Area A (need CS 168 or equivalent), Breadth Area B (need CS 243 or equivalent).

**Output:**
**Currently Not Fully Satisfactory for MS; Needs Breadth Area A & B confirmation**
