===================generated constraints===========================
Sure, let's extract the requirements and constraints from FINRA Rule 2111 on Suitability:

### **Requirements:**

1. **Customer Investment Profile:** 
   - A member or associated person must gather extensive information about the customer, including their age, other investments, financial situation and needs, tax status, investment objectives, investment experience, investment time horizon, liquidity needs, risk tolerance, and any other information disclosed by the customer.

2. **Reasonable Basis:**
   - They must have a reasonable basis to believe that the recommended transaction or investment strategy is suitable for the customer based on the gathered information.

3. **Institutional Accounts:**
   - For institutional accounts, the member or associated person must believe the institutional customer can evaluate investment risks independently.
   - The institutional customer must indicate they are exercising independent judgment.

4. **Three Main Obligations:**
   - **Reasonable-Basis Suitability:** The recommendation must be suitable for at least some investors, based on reasonable diligence about the security or strategy.
   - **Customer-Specific Suitability:** The recommendation must be suitable for the particular customer based on their specific investment profile.
   - **Quantitative Suitability:** A series of recommended transactions must not be excessive when viewed collectively, considering the customer’s investment profile.

5. **Understanding Risks and Rewards:**
   - The member or associated person must understand the potential risks and rewards associated with the recommended security or strategy.

6. **Recommendation and Financial Ability:**
   - The customer must have the financial ability to meet commitments resulting from the recommended transactions or investment strategies.

### **Constraints:**

1. **No Disclaimers Allowed:**
   - A member or associated person cannot disclaim their responsibilities under the suitability rule.

2. **Excluded Communications:**
   - The rule excludes certain communications from its coverage, such as general financial and investment information, descriptive information about employer-sponsored plans, asset allocation models based on general investment theory, and certain interactive investment materials. These must not include specific recommendations.

3. **Institutional Exemptions:**
   - The rule provides an exemption to customer-specific suitability for institutional investors if the customer is capable of evaluating risks independently and indicates independent judgment.

4. **Documentation for Irrelevant Factors:**
   - If any factors in the customer’s investment profile are deemed irrelevant, this must be documented with specificity.

5. **Ethical Standards:**
   - Sales efforts and all dealings must meet ethical standards and the requirement to deal fairly with the public.

6. **Regulation Best Interest:**
   - The rule does not apply to recommendations subject to SEA Rule 15l-1 (“Regulation Best Interest”).

By adhering to these extracted requirements and constraints, FINRA members and associated persons are guided on how to fulfill their suitability obligations when making investment recommendations.===================generated formulas===========================
Certainly! Here's how you can implement the extracted constraints from FINRA Rule 2111 on Suitability using cvc5 SMT formulas:

```smt2
; Declare Customer Attributes
(declare-const Age Int)
(declare-const OtherInvestments Bool)
(declare-const FinancialSituation Int)
(declare-const FinancialNeeds Int)
(declare-const TaxStatus Bool)
(declare-const InvestmentObjectives Bool)
(declare-const InvestmentExperience Bool)
(declare-const InvestmentTimeHorizon Int)
(declare-const LiquidityNeeds Int)
(declare-const RiskTolerance Int)
(declare-const OtherInformation Bool)

; Declare Transaction Attributes
(declare-const InvestmentRisk Int)
(declare-const InvestmentReward Int)
(declare-const CustomerFinancialAbility Int)
(declare-const IndependentJudgment Bool)

; Constraint: Reasonable Basis Suitability
(assert (>= InvestmentRisk 0))
(assert (>= InvestmentReward 0))
(assert (<= InvestmentRisk 100))
(assert (<= InvestmentReward 100))

; Constraint: Customer-Specific Suitability
(assert (>= FinancialSituation 0))
(assert (>= FinancialNeeds 0))
(assert (>= InvestmentTimeHorizon 0))
(assert (>= LiquidityNeeds 0))
(assert (>= RiskTolerance 0))
(assert (<= FinancialSituation 100))
(assert (<= FinancialNeeds 100))
(assert (<= InvestmentTimeHorizon 100))
(assert (<= LiquidityNeeds 100))
(assert (<= RiskTolerance 100))

; Constraint: Institutional Accounts
(declare-const InstitutionalCustomer Bool)
(assert (=> InstitutionalCustomer (and IndependentJudgment (>= InvestmentRisk 50))))

; Constraint: No Disclaimers Allowed
(declare-const Disclaimer Bool)
(assert (not Disclaimer))

; Constraint: Excluded Communications
(declare-const GeneralInfo Bool)
(declare-const EmployerPlanInfo Bool)
(declare-const AssetAllocationModel Bool)
(declare-const InteractiveMaterials Bool)
(assert (not (and (or GeneralInfo EmployerPlanInfo AssetAllocationModel InteractiveMaterials) 
              (exists ((specificRecommendation Bool)) specificRecommendation))))

; Constraint: Documentation for Irrelevant Factors
(declare-const RelevantFactors Bool)
(declare-const DocumentedReason Bool)
(assert (=> (not RelevantFactors) DocumentedReason))

; Constraint: Ethical Standards 
(declare-const SalesEffortsEthical Bool)
(assert SalesEffortsEthical)

; Constraint: Regulation Best Interest Not Applicable
(declare-const RegulationBestInterest Bool)
(assert (not RegulationBestInterest))

; Check satisfiability
(check-sat)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Customer Attributes:** Variables like `Age`, `FinancialSituation`, `InvestmentTimeHorizon`, etc., have been declared to capture the customer's investment profile.
2. **Transaction Attributes:** Variables like `InvestmentRisk` and `InvestmentReward` capture the characteristics of the recommended transaction.
3. **Reasonable Basis Suitability:** We ensure `InvestmentRisk` and `InvestmentReward` are within a reasonable range (0-100 for this example).
4. **Customer-Specific Suitability:** Constraints on `FinancialSituation` and other customer-specific attributes are defined to be within a reasonable range (0-100 for simplicity).
5. **Institutional Accounts:** If the customer is institutional (`InstitutionalCustomer = true`), they must evaluate risks independently (`IndependentJudgment`) and the investment risk must be substantial (greater than or equal to `50`).
6. **No Disclaimers Allowed:** Disclaimers are not allowed, so `Disclaimer` must be false.
7. **Excluded Communications:** General information, employer plan info, asset allocation models, and interactive materials cannot include specific recommendations.
8. **Documentation for Irrelevant Factors:** If factors are marked irrelevant, this must be documented.
9. **Ethical Standards:** Sales efforts must be ethical.
10. **Regulation Best Interest Not Applicable:** This rule does not apply if `RegulationBestInterest` is true.

### Execution:

1. You can run this SMT model using cvc5 or an SMT solver that supports the SMT-LIB language.
2. The solver will check the constraints based on the defined variables and constraints to confirm if the set of conditions is satisfiable (`sat`) or not (`unsat`).

This should give you a robust starting point to work with cvc5 to model the suitability rule constraints effectively!
