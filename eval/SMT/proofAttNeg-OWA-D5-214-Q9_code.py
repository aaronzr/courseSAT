To translate the given statements into CVC5 SMT Python formulas, we'll first define the predicates and individuals:

1. **Predicates:**
   - `smart(x)`
   - `kind(x)`
   - `blue(x)`
   - `nice(x)`
   - `red(x)`
   - `cold(x)`
   - `furry(x)`

2. **Individuals:**
   - `Anne`
   - `Bob`
   - `Gary`
   - `Harry`

Now, let's proceed to translate each statement and finally form the test case to check whether "Gary is nice".

### Translating Statements
We'll use cvc5's Python API to create these formulas. First, let's import and set up the cvc5 environment.

```python
import cvc5
from cvc5 import Kind

# Initialize cvc5 Solver
solver = cvc5.Solver()
solver.setOption("produce-models", "true")

# Define types
Person = solver.getBooleanSort()
Bool = solver.getBooleanSort()

# Define individuals
Anne = solver.mkConst(Person, "Anne")
Bob = solver.mkConst(Person, "Bob")
Gary = solver.mkConst(Person, "Gary")
Harry = solver.mkConst(Person, "Harry")

# Define predicates
smart = solver.mkPredicate(Person, "smart")
kind = solver.mkPredicate(Person, "kind")
blue = solver.mkPredicate(Person, "blue")
nice = solver.mkPredicate(Person, "nice")
red = solver.mkPredicate(Person, "red")
cold = solver.mkPredicate(Person, "cold")
furry = solver.mkPredicate(Person, "furry")

# Sentence translations
# 1. All smart people are kind.
all_smart_are_kind = solver.mkForall([Person], smart(solver.mkVar(Person, "x")).implies(kind(solver.mkVar(Person, "x"))))

# 2. If someone is smart then they are kind.
if_smart_then_kind = solver.mkForall([Person], smart(solver.mkVar(Person, "x")).implies(kind(solver.mkVar(Person, "x"))))

# 3. If someone is blue and smart then they are kind.
if_blue_and_smart_then_kind = solver.mkForall([Person], blue(solver.mkVar(Person, "x")).and_(smart(solver.mkVar(Person, "x"))).implies(kind(solver.mkVar(Person, "x"))))

# 4. Nice people are red.
if_nice_then_red = solver.mkForall([Person], nice(solver.mkVar(Person, "x")).implies(red(solver.mkVar(Person, "x"))))

# 5. If someone is kind and cold then they are furry.
if_kind_and_cold_then_furry = solver.mkForall([Person], kind(solver.mkVar(Person, "x")).and_(cold(solver.mkVar(Person, "x"))).implies(furry(solver.mkVar(Person, "x"))))

# 6. All furry, kind people are smart.
all_furry_and_kind_are_smart = solver.mkForall([Person], furry(solver.mkVar(Person, "x")).and_(kind(solver.mkVar(Person, "x"))).implies(smart(solver.mkVar(Person, "x"))))

# 7. Smart, furry people are nice.
smart_and_furry_are_nice = solver.mkForall([Person], smart(solver.mkVar(Person, "x")).and_(furry(solver.mkVar(Person, "x"))).implies(nice(solver.mkVar(Person, "x"))))

# 8. If Gary is kind and Gary is not blue then Gary is cold.
gary_kind_not_blue_then_cold = kind(Gary).and_(blue(Gary).not_()).implies(cold(Gary))

# Individuals' properties
anne_blue = blue(Anne)
anne_cold = cold(Anne)
bob_blue = blue(Bob)
bob_smart = smart(Bob)
gary_not_blue = blue(Gary).not_()
gary_kind = kind(Gary)
harry_blue = blue(Harry)

# Test statement: Gary is nice
gary_is_nice = nice(Gary)

# Asserting the context
solver.assertFormula(all_smart_are_kind)
solver.assertFormula(if_smart_then_kind)
solver.assertFormula(if_blue_and_smart_then_kind)
solver.assertFormula(if_nice_then_red)
solver.assertFormula(if_kind_and_cold_then_furry)
solver.assertFormula(all_furry_and_kind_are_smart)
solver.assertFormula(smart_and_furry_are_nice)
solver.assertFormula(gary_kind_not_blue_then_cold)

solver.assertFormula(anne_blue)
solver.assertFormula(anne_cold)
solver.assertFormula(bob_blue)
solver.assertFormula(bob_smart)
solver.assertFormula(gary_not_blue)
solver.assertFormula(gary_kind)
solver.assertFormula(harry_blue)

# Check if Gary is nice
solver.push()
solver.assertFormula(gary_is_nice)
result = solver.checkSat()
solver.pop()

print("Is Gary nice?", result)
```

### Explanation:
- **Declaring Variables and Predicates:** We define the `Person` type and individual constants for each person.
- **Predicates:** Functions like `smart`, `kind`, etc., are declared to use with these individuals.
- **Formulas:** Each contextual statement is translated into a logical formula using cvc5's API.
- **Assertions:** We assert each logical condition to the solver.
- **Test Statement:** Finally, we add the test statement "Gary is nice" and check its satisfiability.

By running this script, `solver.checkSat()` will tell us if "Gary is nice" is consistent with the given contextual statements.

Note: The setup for universally quantified statements (i.e., for all statements) can get complex. It might require special handling in the cvc5 setup, which isn't fully showcased in basic scenarios. The code provided assumes a straightforward interpretation. Adjustments might be needed depending on cvc5 capabilities and complex logic requirements.
