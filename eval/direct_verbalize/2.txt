The given SMT formula demystifies the relationship between various university courses, their respective unit counts, and overall constraints. Here is the detailed translation into natural language:

1. **Course Unit Definitions**:
   - The number of units for courses named `course_a`, `course_b`, `course_c`, `course_d`, and `course_e` is defined as follows:
     - `course_a`: 5 units.
     - `course_b`: 5 units.
     - `course_c`: 5 units.
     - `course_d`: 5 units.
     - `course_e`: 5 units.

2. **Course Listings**:
   - `course_a` can be any one of the following courses: "CME 100," "CME 102," "CME 104," "CS 106B," with each course conforming to 5 units.
   - One specific course, "CME 106," is associated with 4 units for `course_a`.

3. **Similar Constraints for Other Courses**:
   - The same courses are valid for `course_b`, `course_c`, `course_d`, and `course_e` as for `course_a`.
   - For each of these courses, if the course listed is "CME 106," then the units are 4.

4. **Additional Course Options for `course_a`**:
   - Besides the previously mentioned courses, `course_a` can also be:
     - "CS 103"
     - "CS109"
     - "Stat116"
     - "MS&E220"
     - "EE178"
     - "CS161"
     - "CS107"
     - "CS107E"
     - "CS110"
     - "CS111"

5. **Overall Unit Constraint**:
   - The sum of the units of `course_a`, `course_b`, `course_c`, `course_d`, and `course_e` cannot exceed 10 units.

6. **Direct Course Equivalencies**:
   - Several courses are treated as equivalent to each other:
     - "CS 103" is equivalent to "CS109," which is equivalent to "Stat116," which is equivalent to "CME106," which is equivalent to "MS&E220," which is equivalent to "EE178," which is equivalent to "CS161," which is equivalent to "CS107," which is equivalent to "CS107E," which is equivalent to "CS110," which is equivalent to "CS111."

In summary, this SMT formula outlines a specific set of courses that can be chosen for variables `course_a`, `course_b`, `course_c`, `course_d`, and `course_e`, with constraints on units and other permissible courses, ensuring that the total credit load does not exceed 10 units. Additionally, it specifies several courses that are considered equivalent to each other and interchangeable in this setup.
