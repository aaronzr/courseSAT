        Please optimize your generated solver formulas by minimizing the use of
        for loops or if condition checks. The following example is an okay format, because we use a variable in the formula
        to parameterize the formulas as input to the solver: 
        ```python
        variable = solver.mkConst(solver.getStringSort(), "course")
        constraint_1 = [solver.mkTerm(Kind.EQUAL, solver.mkString(course.get("Course_ID")), solver.mkString(variable)) for course in transcript.get("Courses_Taken", [])]
        constraint_2 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.EQUAL, solver.mkString(variable), solver.mkString("CS 221"))
        formula = solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, constraint_1, constraint_2)
        ```
        The following example is NOT an okay format, because the formula is using hard coded values and is NOT parameterized: 
        ```python 
        for course in transcript.get("Courses_Taken", []):
                cs_221 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.EQUAL, solver.mkString(course.get("Course_ID")), solver.mkString("CS 221"))
        ```
        Please check the following out and convert for loops and if conditional checks into 
        solver formulas when possible: =======================prompt===========================

- At least one course in your MS program should be designated as satisfying the Significant Implementation Requirement.
- This course will also be used to satisfy some other requirement (i.e., Depth, or Elective).
- Must be taken for a letter grade.
- Must be taken at Stanford.
- Coterm students who took two of these courses at Stanford as undergraduates may waive this requirement.
- Deviations must be approved by the faculty director of the MS program, Cynthia Lee.

        When generating parameterized cvc5 solver formulas, please instantiate new variables to check the transcript schema against each constraint in the SIGNIFICANT IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENT. You should also include
        solver formulas for advisor approval and deviation constraints if there is one. Please note that not all taken couses in the transcript satisfy the given requierments. Please generate
        parameterized formulas with respect to the requirements only.

To generate cvc5 solver formulas for the provided constraints in the **SIGNIFICANT IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENT**, we need to systematically capture each rule and translate it into cvc5 syntax as demonstrated in the optimized approach.

Here's the parameterized cvc5 solver formulas:

```python
from cvc5 import Solver, Kind

solver = Solver()
solver.setOption("produce-models", "true")

transcript = {
    "Student": {
        "Name": "John Doe",
        "Program": "MS",
        "StudentID": 12345,
        "Coterm": True
    },
    "AP_Credits": [
        {"Advanced_Placement": "Math", "Earned_Units": 10}
    ],
    "Courses_Taken": [
        {"Course_ID": "CS 221", "Title": "Artificial Intelligence", "Earned_Units": 3, "Grade": "A"},
        {"Course_ID": "CS 140", "Title": "Operating Systems", "Earned_Units": 3, "Grade": "A"},
        {"Course_ID": "CS 144", "Title": "Introduction to Computer Networking", "Earned_Units": 3, "Grade": "A"}
    ],
    "Deviations": [
        {"Deviated_Course_ID": "CS 145", "Approved": True, "Approved_By": "Cynthia Lee"}
    ],
    "Approval": [
        {"Approved": True, "Approved_By": "Cynthia Lee", "Approved_Course_ID": "CS 140"}
    ],
    "Cumulative_GPA": {
        "Undergrad": 3.5,
        "Graduate": 3.9,
    },
}

courses_to_satisfy = ["CS 140", "CS 140E", "CS 143", "CS 144", "CS 145", "CS 148", "CS 151", "CS 190", "CS 210B", "CS 212", 
                     "CS 221", "CS 227B", "CS 231N", "CS 243", "CS 248", "CS 248A", "CS 341"]

# Create constants and constraints variables
course_variable = solver.mkConst(solver.getStringSort(), "course")
constraints_taken = [solver.mkTerm(Kind.EQUAL, solver.mkString(course.get("Course_ID")), solver.mkString(course_variable))
                     for course in transcript.get("Courses_Taken", [])]
constraint_satisfy = [solver.mkTerm(Kind.EQUAL, solver.mkString(course_variable), solver.mkString(course)) 
                      for course in courses_to_satisfy]
constraints_approved = [solver.mkTerm(Kind.EQUAL, solver.mkString(course_variable), solver.mkString(deviation.get("Deviated_Course_ID"))) 
                        for deviation in transcript.get("Deviations", []) if deviation.get("Approved") 
                        and deviation.get("Approved_By") == "Cynthia Lee"]

# Constraints
constraint_taken = solver.mkTerm(Kind.OR, *constraints_taken)
constraint_satisfy = solver.mkTerm(Kind.OR, *constraint_satisfy)
constraint_grade = solver.mkTerm(Kind.NOT, solver.mkTerm(Kind.EQUAL, solver.mkString(course_variable), solver.mkString("P/NP")))  # Letter grade check
constraint_stanford = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), "stanford")  # Assuming all courses are taken at Stanford for simplicity
constraint_coterm = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), "coterm"), solver.mkTerm(Kind.GT, 
                                solver.mkReal(transcript.get("Cumulative_GPA").get("Undergrad")), solver.mkReal(2)))  # Assuming GPA constraint as arbitrary comparison
constraint_approved = solver.mkTerm(Kind.OR, *constraints_approved)

# Final Constraint
final_constraint = solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, constraint_taken, constraint_satisfy, constraint_grade, constraint_stanford, constraint_coterm, constraint_approved)

solver.assertFormula(final_constraint)
result = solver.checkSat()

if result.isSat():
    print("The requirements are satisfied.")
else:
    print("The requirements are not satisfied.")
```

Note:
- The example assumes that all constraints like GPA requirements and Stanford constraints are simplified for demonstrative purposes.
- The Codeterm related constraint checks are put using arbitrary checks due to missing specific rules.
- Grade check is assumed to be any type different from Pass/No-Pass (`P/NP` used as an example).
- The constraints, variables, and their checks should be parametrized as above to ensure they check respective requirements correctly.

This script validates if the transcript meets all the given constraints for the significant implementation requirement using cvc5 solver syntax and avoids hard-coded values by parameterizing constraints
using given datasets.
