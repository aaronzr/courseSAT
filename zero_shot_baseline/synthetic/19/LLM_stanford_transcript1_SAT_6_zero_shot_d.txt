Emily Berkowitz has not satisfied all the BS requirements.========================GPT Answer to Prompt Two Regarding MS Requirements====================
To determine whether Emily Ann Berkowitz has satisfied the Master of Science (MS) degree requirements in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence at Stanford University, we need to verify the following requirements based on her transcript:

### Foundations Requirement

CS223A (3 units),
CS224N (3 units),
CS237A (3 units),
CS228 (3 units),
CS229 (4 units),
