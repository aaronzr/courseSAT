**BS Degree Requirements Analysis**

**1. Core Requirements (30 units minimum)**
- **Systems**
  - CS 106B: Programming Abstractions (Completed in Winter 2019 - CS 102 Data Structures, assuming it's equivalent)
  - CS 107: Computer Organization and Systems (Completed in Autumn 2020)
  - CS 111: Operating Systems Principles (Completed in Autumn 2021 - CS 202 Operating Systems)

- **Theory**
  - CS 103: Mathematical Foundations of Computing (Did not complete)
  - CS 109: Introduction to Probability for Computer Scientists (Did not complete)
  - CS 161: Design and Analysis of Algorithms (Completed in Spring 2020 - CS 201 Algorithms, assuming it's equivalent)

**2. Senior Project Requirements**
- Courses such as CS 194, 194W, 210B, 191, 191W, 294 (Completed CS 403 Deep Learning in Spring 2023. However, it needs to be verified if it qualifies as a senior project; assuming it does for now.)

**3. AI Elective Requirements Analysis**
- Mathematics (26 units minimum)
  - MATH 19/20/21 (Equivalent completed via AP credit)
  - CS 103 (Did not complete)
  - CS 109 (Did not complete)
  - Two electives (CS-related)
    - MATH 41: Calculus I (Satisfactory)
    - MATH 51: Linear Algebra (Completed Winter 2021)
    - MATH 113: Introduction to Complex Variables (Completed Autumn 2021)

- **Science (11 units minimum)**
  - PHYS 41: Mechanics, or PHYS 21 or 61 (Completed PHYS 101/102/103 series)
  - PHYS 43: Electricity and Magnetism (Did not complete)
  - One elective from the SoE approved science list (Completed PHY 105 Quantum Mechanics)

- **Technology in Society Requirement (1 course required)**
  - No record in transcript; presumably missing.

- **Engineering Fundamentals (10 units minimum)**
  - CS 106B: Programming Abstractions (Equivalent in CS 102 Data Structures, assuming it's equivalent)
  - ENGR 40M or 76 (Did not complete, no relevant courses)

**Summary for BS Requirements:**
Mirror the specific courses from the breadth area and senior projects.

**BS SAT**: Not currently satisfied due to missing:
- CS 103: Mathematical Foundations of Computing
- CS 109: Introduction to Probability for Computer Scientists
- PHYS 43: Electricity and Magnetism or equivalent 
- Technology in Society Requirement
- Engineering Fundamentals (ENGR 40M or relevant course)

**MS Degree Requirements Analysis**

**1. Foundations Requirement**
Courses completed:
- Logic, Automata & Complexity (CS103) – Not completed
- Probability (CS109, Stat116, CME106, MS&E220, or EE178) – Not completed
- Algorithmic Analysis (CS161) – Assumed completed via CS 201 Algorithms
- Computer Organization & Systems (CS107 or 107E) – Completed in Autumn 2020
- Principles of Computer Systems (CS110 or CS111) – Assumed completed via CS 202 Operating Systems in Autumn 2020

**2. Significant Implementation Requirement**
- No specific course record provided.

**3. Breadth Requirement**
- Area A:  Not completed
- Area B:  Not completed
- Area C:  Not completed
- Area D:  Not completed

**4. Artificial Intelligence Depth**
Depth course completion (21 units total from categories a, b, c):
- At least four specific elective courses: Details not clear to determine if met

**5. Electives**
- No specified elective data given

**Summary for MS Requirements:**
Consider the broader undergraduate completion as pre-requisite. Specific course record assessments.

**MS SAT**: Not satisfied due to:
- Missing CS103: Mathematical Foundations of Computing
- Missing CS 109: Introduction to Probability for Computer Scientists
- Significant Implementation, Breadth Area, AI Depth require clarity.
- Insufficient Electives units to complete 45 total.

**Final Summary**
- **BS SAT**: Not satisfied. Missing specific courses and parts of requirements check.
- **MS SAT**: Not satisfied. Incomplete courses from breadth to electives.

Courses missing for completion are marked clearly, pointing to critical gaps in required course units completion.
