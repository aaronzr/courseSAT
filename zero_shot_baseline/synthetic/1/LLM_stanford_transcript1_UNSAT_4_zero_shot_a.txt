==========================================### Analysis for BS and MS Requirements

#### Part 1: Bachelor of Science (BS) Requirements Check

**Core Requirements:**
- **Programming Abstractions (CS 106B)**: Completed in 2019-2020 Winter with a grade of D+.
- **Computer Organization and Systems (CS 107)**: Completed in 2020-2021 Autumn with a grade of D.
- **Operating Systems Principles (CS 111)**: Completed in 2021-2022 Autumn with a grade of D-.
- **Mathematical Foundations of Computing (CS 103)**: Not listed.
- **Introduction to Probability for Computer Scientists (CS 109)**: Completed in 2020-2021 Winter with a grade of D+.
- **Design and Analysis of Algorithms (CS 161)**: Completed in 2021-2022 Autumn with a grade of D+.

**Senior Project Requirement:**
- No evidence of completion in transcript provided.

**Math Requirements:**
- MATH 19, MATH 20, MATH 21: Attempted MATH 19 (Calculus) in 2019-2020 Autumn with a grade of D.
- MATH 51: Completed in 2020-2021 Autumn with a grade of D+.
- Other Math courses (electives and Multivariate Calculus): Completed MATH 52 (Multivariate Calculus) in 2020-2021 Spring with a grade of D+ and MATH 53 (Complex Variables) in 2022-2023 Autumn with a grade of D+.

**Science Requirements:**
- PHYS 41 (Mechanics): Completed PHYS 21 Mechanics in 2019-2020 Winter with a grade of C+.
- PHYS 43 (Electricity and Magnetism): Completed PHYS 43 in 2019-2020 Spring with a grade of C-.
- Electives: Evidence of BIO (7 different courses), CHEM (3 courses), PHYS (3 courses) indicates this could be satisfied.

**Technology in Society Requirement:**
- Not listed in transcript provided.

**Engineering Fundamentals:**
- CS 106B: Attempted in 2019-2020 Winter with a grade of D+.
- ENGR 40m/76: Not listed in transcript provided.

**Depth Requirements:**
- Multiple attempts and completions in various CS and BIO courses, but specific track not clearly mentioned.

### Conclusion for BS:
- **"BS NOT SAT"**

**Issues Identified:**
1. Low grades in key core courses (D+'s and D's in major CS subjects).
2. MATH 19, 51, 52, and 53 grades are below expected standards.
3. Evidence for required Senior Project completion is missing.
4. Missing evidence for Technology in Society and proper record of Engineering Fundamentals.

#### Part 2: Master of Science (MS) Requirements Check

**Foundations Requirement:**
- **Logic, Automata & Complexity (CS 103)**: Not listed.
- **Probability (CS 109 or equivalent)**: Completed in undergrad with a grade of D+.
- **Algorithmic Analysis (CS 161)**: Completed in undergrad with a grade of D+.
- **Computer Organization & Systems (CS 107)**: Completed in undergrad with a grade of D.
- **Principles of Computer Systems (CS 111)**: Completed in undergrad with a grade of D-.

**Significant Implementation Requirement:**
- Evidence is required that a course meeting implementation requirement is completed.

**Breadth Requirement:**
- Needs completion in different Breadth Areas; specific courses not detailed in transcript.

**Artificial Intelligence Depth:**
- CS 221: Completed in 2021-2022 Winter with a grade of D.
- Additional depth courses not specifically listed such as CS 223A, CS 224N, etc., though CS 224N attempted with D.

**Electives:**
- Various electives attempted in CS and BIO topics mentioned in transcript but needs detail configuration for synthesis.

### Conclusion for MS:
- **"MS NOT SAT"**

**Issues Identified:**
1. Low grades in foundational requirements.
2. Depth and implementation requirements not clearly fulfilled with requisite units and letter grades.
3. Breadth area coverage not clear from records provided.

### Final Output:
- **BS NOT SAT**
- **MS NOT SAT**
