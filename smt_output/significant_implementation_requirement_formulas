        Your task is to generate cvc5 smt solver formulas for the constraints in each requirement SIGNIFICANT IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENT: 

At least one course in your MS program should be designated as satisfying the Significant Implementation Requirement. Note that this course will also be used to satisfy some other requirement (i.e., Depth, or Elective). 

Must be taken for a letter grade,* must be taken at Stanford. Coterm students who took two of these courses at Stanford as undergraduates may waive this requirement. Deviations must be approved by the faculty director of the MS program, Cynthia Lee.

Course Number: Title: Grade

Courses that may be used to satisfy the Significant Implementation Requirement include: CS 140, 140E, 143, 144, 145, 148, 151, 190, 210B, 212, 221, 227B, 231N, 243, 248/248A, and 341. you have identified.
        Your formulas should include every constraint, including the ones related to advisor approval and deviations.
        The formulas will check satisfiability of a given transcript schema template as input in the following format:

        =======================formula ouput===========================
To generate the cvc5 SMT solver formulas for the constraints specified in the requirement, we'll start by defining the necessary constraints step by step for the Significant Implementation Requirement (SIR).

### Definitions and Declarations:

1. **Declare constants for student information and courses taken:**
```smt2
(set-logic ALL)

(declare-const coterm Bool)
(declare-const undergrad_gpa Real)
(declare-const grad_gpa Real)

(declare-const course_Significant_Implementation_1 String)
(declare-const course_Significant_Implementation_2 String)
(declare-const grade_Significant_Implementation String)
```

2. **Define sets for valid SIR courses and valid letter grades:**
```smt2
(define-fun is_sir_course ((course String)) Bool
  (or (= course "CS 140") 
      (= course "CS 140E") 
      (= course "CS 143")
      (= course "CS 144")
      (= course "CS 145")
      (= course "CS 148")
      (= course "CS 151")
      (= course "CS 190")
      (= course "CS 210B")
      (= course "CS 212")
      (= course "CS 221")
      (= course "CS 227B")
      (= course "CS 231N")
      (= course "CS 243")
      (= course "CS 248")
      (= course "CS 248A")
      (= course "CS 341")))
      
(define-fun is_letter_grade ((grade String)) Bool
  (or (= grade "A")
      (= grade "B")
      (= grade "C")
      (= grade "D")))
```

### Constraints for SIR:

3. **Constraint for a course to be a valid SIR course and have a letter grade:**
```smt2
(define-fun constraint_sir_valid_courses ((course String) (grade String)) Bool
  (and (is_sir_course course) (is_letter_grade grade)))
```

4. **Constraints for coterm students: If a coterminal student has already taken two SIR-courses as an undergrad, they do not need to take another one:**
```smt2
(declare-const coterm_course1 String)
(declare-const coterm_course2 String)
(declare-const coterm_grade1 String)
(declare-const coterm_grade2 String)

(define-fun coterm_sir_satisfied () Bool
  (and coterm
       (constraint_sir_valid_courses coterm_course1 coterm_grade1)
       (constraint_sir_valid_courses coterm_course2 coterm_grade2)))
```

5. **Constraint for deviation approval:**
```smt2
(declare-const deviation_approved Bool)
(declare-const deviated_course String)
(declare-const approved_by String)

(define-fun is_deviation_approved () Bool
  (and deviation_approved (= approved_by "Cynthia Lee")))
```

6. **Combining constraints for non-coterm students: At least one course must satisfy the SIR requirement:**
```smt2
(define-fun non_coterm_sir_satisfied () Bool
  (or (constraint_sir_valid_courses course_Significant_Implementation_1 grade_Significant_Implementation)
      (is_deviation_approved)))
```

7. **Final combined constraint for all students:**
```smt2
(define-fun sir_requirement_satisfied () Bool
  (or (coterm_sir_satisfied) (non_coterm_sir_satisfied)))
```

### Final Formula:

```smt2
(assert (sir_requirement_satisfied))
(check-sat)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Transcript Variables:** We declare constants for the studentâ€™s coterm status, GPA, courses, and grades taken.
2. **SIR Course Set and Letter Grades:** We define functions to check if a course is a valid SIR course and if a grade is a valid letter grade.
3. **Course Validation Constraints:** We define constraints to ensure a course is a valid SIR course and has a valid letter grade.
4. **Coterm Constraints:** We set constraints for coterm students to check if they have already taken two valid SIR courses as undergrads.
5. **Deviation Constraints:** We set constraints to check if any deviations have been approved by Cynthia Lee.
6. **Overall SIR Satisfaction Constraints:** We define the overall constraints to check if the SIR requirement is satisfied either by coterm conditions, valid courses taken, or an approved deviation.
7. **Final Assertion:** We assert the final combined constraint to check if it is satisfied.

This approach ensures all requirements and constraints are covered in the generated SMT formulas.
