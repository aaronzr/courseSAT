For simplicity, we'll use the following predicates:
- `Furry(x)` means x is furry.
- `Blue(x)` means x is blue.
- `Nice(x)` means x is nice.
- `Green(x)` means x is green.
- `Smart(x)` means x is smart.
- `Quiet(x)` means x is quiet.
- `Big(x)` means x is big.

Here's the translation of each statement:

1. **Statement:** If someone is furry then they are blue.
   ```python
   solver.assert_formula(Forall([x], Implies(Furry(x), Blue(x))))
   ```

2. **Statement:** If someone is furry and nice then they are green.
   ```python
   solver.assert_formula(Forall([x], Implies(And(Furry(x), Nice(x)), Green(x))))
   ```

3. **Statement:** If someone is smart then they are quiet.
   ```python
   solver.assert_formula(Forall([x], Implies(Smart(x), Quiet(x))))
   ```

4. **Statement:** Nice, blue people are furry.
   ```python
   solver.assert_formula(Forall([x], Implies(And(Nice(x), Blue(x)), Furry(x))))
   ```

5. **Statement:** Blue, furry people are nice.
   ```python
   solver.assert_formula(Forall([x], Implies(And(Blue(x), Furry(x)), Nice(x))))
   ```

6. **Statement:** Green, smart people are furry.
   ```python
   solver.assert_formula(Forall([x], Implies(And(Green(x), Smart(x)), Furry(x))))
   ```

7. **Statement:** If Charlie is quiet then Charlie is furry.
   ```python
   solver.assert_formula(Implies(Quiet(Charlie), Furry(Charlie)))
   ```

8. **Statement:** All big, blue people are green.
   ```python
   solver.assert_formula(Forall([x], Implies(And(Big(x), Blue(x)), Green(x))))
   ```

9. **Statement:** All blue people are smart.
   ```python
   solver.assert_formula(Forall([x], Implies(Blue(x), Smart(x))))
   ```

10. **Statement:** Anne is furry.
    ```python
    solver.assert_formula(Furry(Anne))
    ```

11. **Statement:** Anne is green.
    ```python
    solver.assert_formula(Green(Anne))
    ```

12. **Statement:** Anne is nice.
    ```python
    solver.assert_formula(Nice(Anne))
    ```

13. **Statement:** Anne is quiet.
    ```python
    solver.assert_formula(Quiet(Anne))
    ```

14. **Statement:** Charlie is smart.
    ```python
    solver.assert_formula(Smart(Charlie))
    ```

15. **Statement:** Dave is blue.
    ```python
    solver.assert_formula(Blue(Dave))
    ```

16. **Statement:** Dave is nice.
    ```python
    solver.assert_formula(Nice(Dave))
    ```

17. **Statement:** Fiona is blue.
    ```python
    solver.assert_formula(Blue(Fiona))
    ```

18. **Statement:** Fiona is furry.
    ```python
    solver.assert_formula(Furry(Fiona))
    ```

19. **Statement:** Fiona is smart.
    ```python
    solver.assert_formula(Smart(Fiona))
    ```

Now, let's write the test statement and execute the solver to check its satisfiability.

**Test Statement:** Charlie is not furry.
```python
solver.assert_formula(Not(Furry(Charlie)))
```

Here's the consolidated CVC5 python script to perform the evaluation:

```python
import cvc5
from cvc5 import Solver, Sort, Term, DatatypeDecl, DatatypeConstructorDecl

# Create the solver instance
solver = Solver()

# Create the sorts
person = solver.getSort("Person")

# Create the predicate functions
Furry = solver.mkConst(solver.mkDatatypeSort(person), "Furry")
Blue = solver.mkConst(solver.mkDatatypeSort(person), "Blue")
Nice = solver.mkConst(solver.mkDatatypeSort(person), "Nice")
Green = solver.mkConst(solver.mkDatatypeSort(person), "Green")
Smart = solver.mkConst(solver.mkDatatypeSort(person), "Smart")
Quiet = solver.mkConst(solver.mkDatatypeSort(person), "Quiet")
Big = solver.mkConst(solver.mkDatatypeSort(person), "Big")

# Create the named constants
Anne = solver.mkConst(person, "Anne")
Charlie = solver.mkConst(person, "Charlie")
Dave = solver.mkConst(person, "Dave")
Fiona = solver.mkConst(person, "Fiona")

# Add the statements
solver.assert_formula(Forall([x], Implies(Furry(x), Blue(x))))
solver.assert_formula(Forall([x], Implies(And(Furry(x), Nice(x)), Green(x))))
solver.assert_formula(Forall([x], Implies(Smart(x), Quiet(x))))
solver.assert_formula(Forall([x], Implies(And(Nice(x), Blue(x)), Furry(x))))
solver.assert_formula(Forall([x], Implies(And(Blue(x), Furry(x)), Nice(x))))
solver.assert_formula(Forall([x], Implies(And(Green(x), Smart(x)), Furry(x))))
solver.assert_formula(Implies(Quiet(Charlie), Furry(Charlie)))
solver.assert_formula(Forall([x], Implies(And(Big(x), Blue(x)), Green(x))))
solver.assert_formula(Forall([x], Implies(Blue(x), Smart(x))))
solver.assert_formula(Furry(Anne))
solver.assert_formula(Green(Anne))
solver.assert_formula(Nice(Anne))
solver.assert_formula(Quiet(Anne))
solver.assert_formula(Smart(Charlie))
solver.assert_formula(Blue(Dave))
solver.assert_formula(Nice(Dave))
solver.assert_formula(Blue(Fiona))
solver.assert_formula(Furry(Fiona))
solver.assert_formula(Smart(Fiona))

# Add the test statement
solver.assert_formula(Not(Furry(Charlie)))

# Solver check
result = solver.checkSat()
print("Satisfiability:", result)
```

The code sets up the necessary logical constraints and uses CVC5 to check whether the test statement "Charlie is not furry" is satisfiable based on the given contextual statements. Run this script with a CVC5-compatible environment to see the result.
