To solve the given problem using z3py, we need to translate the constraints and choices into logical formulations. Below is the Python code using z3py for the given file.

```python
from z3 import *

# Declare the enum sets representing the different kinds of food for each meal
Breakfast = ["hot_cakes", "poached_eggs", "omelet"]
Lunch = ["fish", "hot_cakes", "macaroni", "omelet"]
Dinner = ["fish", "hot_cakes", "macaroni", "omelet"]
Snack = ["fish", "omelet"]

# Declare variables representing the food each person eats at each meal
Vladimir_breakfast = String('Vladimir_breakfast')
Vladimir_lunch = String('Vladimir_lunch')
Vladimir_dinner = String('Vladimir_dinner')
Vladimir_snack = String('Vladimir_snack')

Wendy_breakfast = String('Wendy_breakfast')
Wendy_lunch = String('Wendy_lunch')
Wendy_dinner = String('Wendy_dinner')
Wendy_snack = String('Wendy_snack')

# Define the solver
s = Solver()

# Add the domain constraints for Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, and Snack
s.add(Or([Vladimir_breakfast == food for food in Breakfast]))
s.add(Or([Vladimir_lunch == food for food in Lunch]))
s.add(Or([Vladimir_dinner == food for food in Dinner]))
s.add(Or([Vladimir_snack == food for food in Snack]))

s.add(Or([Wendy_breakfast == food for food in Breakfast]))
s.add(Or([Wendy_lunch == food for food in Lunch]))
s.add(Or([Wendy_dinner == food for food in Dinner]))
s.add(Or([Wendy_snack == food for food in Snack]))

# Add constraints that they don't eat the same food at the same meal
s.add(Vladimir_breakfast != Wendy_breakfast)
s.add(Vladimir_lunch != Wendy_lunch)
s.add(Vladimir_dinner != Wendy_dinner)
s.add(Vladimir_snack != Wendy_snack)

# Wendy eats an omelet for lunch
s.add(Wendy_lunch == "omelet")

# Neither of them eats the same kind of food more than once during the day
meals = [Vladimir_breakfast, Vladimir_lunch, Vladimir_dinner, Vladimir_snack,
         Wendy_breakfast, Wendy_lunch, Wendy_dinner, Wendy_snack]

s.add(Distinct(meals))

# Try each choice and determine which one must be true
choices = ["fish", "hot_cakes", "macaroni", "omelet", "poached_eggs"]

for choice in choices:
    test_solver = s.translate(s.ctx)
    test_solver.add(Vladimir_lunch == choice)
    
    if test_solver.check() == sat:
        print(f"Vladimir must eat: {choice}")
```

This code sets up the problem with the necessary constraints using z3py. It defines the possible food items for each meal, enforces that neither Vladimir nor Wendy eat the same food for the same meal, and ensures that each meal is distinct.
The code also places the specified condition that Wendy eats an omelet for lunch and then checks each possible lunch choice for Vladimir to see which one must be true in the given conditions.
