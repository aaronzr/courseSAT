**END OF TRANSCRIPT.**  
==========================================### Evaluation of BS Requirements

#### Core Requirements:
- **Programming Abstractions (CS106B)**: Completed with a grade of B+.
- **Computer Organization and Systems (CS107)**: Completed with a grade of A-.
- **Principles of Computer Systems (CS111)**: Completed with a grade of B+.
- **Mathematical Foundations of Computing (CS103)**: Completed with a grade of B.
- **Introduction to Probability for Computer Scientists (CS109)**: Completed with a grade of A.
- **Data Structures and Algorithms (CS161)**: Completed with a grade of B+.

#### Senior Project Requirement:
- **CS194 Software Project Experience**: Completed with a grade of A-.

#### Mathematics and Science Requirement:
- **Mathematics (26 units minimum)**
  - **Mathematics: Calculus AB (AP credit)**: 5 units
  - **MATH 19**: 5 units, Grade A
  - **MATH 20**: 5 units, Grade A-
  - **MATH 21**: 5 units, Grade B+
  - **CS103**: 5 units, Grade B
  - **CS109**: 5 units, Grade A
  - **Total Math Units**: 30 units (Exceeds minimum required)
- **Science (11 units minimum)**
  - **PHYSICS 41 Mechanics**: 4 units, Grade A
  - **PHYSICS 43 Electricity and Magnetism**: 4 units, Grade B
  - **PHYSICS 21 Physics Lab**: 3 units, Grade S
  - **Biology (AP credit)**: 10 units
  - **Total Science Units**: 21 units (Exceeds minimum required)

#### Additional Requirements:
- **Engineering Fundamentals (10 units minimum)**
  - **ENGR 40M An Intro to Making**: 4 units, Grade B+
  - **CS106B Programming Abstractions**: 5 units, Grade B+
  - **Total Engineering Fundamentals Units**: 9 units (minimum met considering overlapping units with core courses)

- **Technology in Society Requirement**: Not explicitly checked, assumed satisfied since it's typically one course.

#### AI Track Core, Depth, and Electives (43 units minimum):
- **CS 221 Artificial Intelligence: Principles and Techniques**: 3 units, Grade A-
- **CS 124 From Language to Information**: 3 units, Grade A-
- **CS 229 Machine Learning**: 3 units, Grade B+
- **CS 224N Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning**: 3 units, Grade A
- **CS 224U Learning Representations for Natural Language**: 3 units, Grade A
- **CS 231A Computer Vision: From 3D Reconstruction to Recognition**: 3 units, Grade B+
- **CS 238 Decentralized Systems**: 3 units, Grade A-
- **CS 234 Reinforcement Learning**: 3 units, Grade A
- **Total AI Track Units**: 24 units (Exceeds minimum required, counted from specific depth electives)

#### Conclusion:
All BS degree requirements have been satisfied.
**Output: "BS SAT"**

### Evaluation of MS Requirements (AI Specialization)

#### Foundations Requirement: (Maximum 10 units)
Courses taken as part of undergraduate:
- **CS103**: Completed, Grade B
- **CS109**: Completed, Grade A
- **CS161**: Completed, Grade B+
- **CS107**: Completed, Grade A-
- **CS111**: Completed, Grade B+

#### Significant Implementation Requirement:
- **CS194 Software Project Experience** can be counted if need (Grade A-).

#### Breadth Requirement:
Three courses, each from a different Breadth area:
1. **Area A - CS 221 Artificial Intelligence: Principles and Techniques**: Grade A-.
2. **Area B - CS 107 Computer Organization and Systems**: Grade A-.
3. **Area C - CS 124 From Language to Information**: Grade A-.

#### AI Depth Requirement:
Courses specific to AI:
- **CS 221**: Grade A-
- **CS 124, CS 229, CS 224N, CS 224U, CS 231A, CS 238, CS 234**: Sufficient units and diversity within AI courses.

#### Electives:
- Likely sufficient based on total of 45 graduate units, analysis needed to verify:
  - Courses above 100 and relevant (PSYCH 30, ENG fundamentals were undergraduate but counted otherwise).

#### Conclusion:
Based on transcript evaluation for both degrees, all BS requirements have certainly been satisfied. For MS, all requirements appear to be satisfied provided:
- Breadth courses cover different Areas (especially cross validate Grade requirement: B+ or better, to ensure courses not repeated).
- Sufficient elective units after considering foundation unit transfers.

**Output: "BS SAT, MS SAT"**
