        Your task is to generate cvc5 python solver formulas for the constraints in each requirement **SIGNIFICANT IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENT:**

- At least one course in your MS program should be designated as satisfying the Significant Implementation Requirement.
- This course will also be used to satisfy some other requirement (i.e., Depth, or Elective).
- Must be taken for a letter grade.
- Must be taken at Stanford.
- Coterm students who took two of these courses at Stanford as undergraduates may waive this requirement.
- Deviations must be approved by the faculty director of the MS program, Cynthia Lee.

**Courses that may be used to satisfy the significant implementation requirement include:** 
- CS 140, 140E, 143, 144, 145, 148, 151, 190, 210B, 212, 221, 227B, 231N, 243, 248/248A, and 341.

        Your formulas should include every constrint, including the ones related to advisor approval and deviations.
        The formulas will check satisfiability of a given transcript schema template as input in the following format:

        When generating parameterized cvc5 solver formulas, please instantiate new variables to check the transcript schema against each constraint in the SIGNIFICANT IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENT. You should also include
        solver formulas for advisor approval and deviation constraints if there is one. Please note that not all taken couses in the transcript satisfy the given requierments. Please generate
        parameterized formulas with respect to the requirements only. 
        =======================formula ouput===========================
To generate parameterized cvc5 solver formulas for the **SIGNIFICANT IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENT**, we need to ensure that each constraint is explicitly captured and that deviations and approvals are also considered. Here's the cvc5 solver formulas for each requirement based on the given transcript schema:

```python
from cvc5 import Solver, Kind

def significant_implementation_constraint(transcript):
    solver = Solver()
    solver.setLogic("ALL")
    
    # Extract courses from the transcript
    courses_taken = transcript.get("Courses_Taken", [])
    significant_courses = ["CS 140", "CS 140E", "CS 143", "CS 144", "CS 145", "CS 148", "CS 151",
                           "CS 190", "CS 210B", "CS 212", "CS 221", "CS 227B", "CS 231N",
                           "CS 243", "CS 248", "CS 248A", "CS 341"]

    # Boolean to indicate if significant implementation requirement is satisfied
    significant_course_found = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), "significant_course_found")
    solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(Kind.EQUAL, significant_course_found, solver.mkBoolean(False)))

    # Identify if any significant implementation course is taken
    significant_constraints = []
    for course in courses_taken:
        course_id = solver.mkString(course["Course_ID"])
        course_grade = solver.mkString(course["Grade"])
        
        # Check if the course is a significant implementation course
        is_significant = solver.mkTerm(Kind.OR, [
            solver.mkTerm(Kind.EQUAL, course_id, solver.mkString(c)) for c in significant_courses
        ])
        
        # Check that the course is taken for a letter grade
        is_letter_grade = solver.mkTerm(Kind.OR, [
            solver.mkTerm(Kind.EQUAL, course_grade, solver.mkString(g)) for g in ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F"]
        ])
        
        # Combine the constraints for a significant course and letter grade
        significant_constraints.append(

    solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(Kind.IFF, significant_course_found, significant_course_constraint))
    
    # Check if the student is a coterm student
    coterm = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), "coterm")
    solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(Kind.EQUAL, coterm, solver.mkBoolean(transcript.get("Student", {}).get("Coterm", False))))

    # Identify if coterm student can waive the requirement
    if transcript.get("Student", {}).get("Coterm", False):
        significant_courses_taken_during_undergrad = [
            course for course in courses_taken if course["Course_ID"] in significant_courses
        ]
        waive_requirement = len(significant_courses_taken_during_undergrad) >= 2
        waive_bool = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), "waive_requirement")

    deviations = transcript.get("Deviations", [])
    deviation_constraints = []
    for deviation in deviations:
        approved = solver.mkBoolean(deviation["Approved"])
        approved_by = solver.mkString(deviation["Approved_By"])
        correct_director = solver.mkTerm(Kind.EQUAL, approved_by, solver.mkString("Cynthia Lee"))
        deviation_constraints.append(solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, approved, correct_director))
    
    all_deviations_approved = solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, deviation_constraints) if deviation_constraints else solver.mkBoolean(True)

    # Final formula constraints
    significant_formula = solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, significant_course_found, all_deviations_approved, waiver_condition)
    solver.assertFormula(significant_formula)

    # Check satisfiability
    result = solver.checkSat()
    return result.isSat()

# Example transcript
transcript = {
    "Student": {
        "Name": "John Doe",
        "Program": "MS in CS",
        "StudentID": 12345,
        "Coterm": True
    },

# Test function
print(significant_implementation_constraint(transcript))
```

In the above code, we create a cvc5 solver instance and generate constraints specific to the **SIGNIFICANT IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENT**. It reads the `transcript` dictionary and ensures:

1. At least one significant implementation course is taken and has a valid letter grade.
2. If the student is a coterm student and has taken two significant courses as undergraduates, the requirement is waived.
3. Any deviations must be approved by "Cynthia Lee".

We combine these constraints and check if the result is `satisfiable`.
