To determine if the student has satisfied the BS and MS degree requirements, we'll need to analyze their transcript according to the detailed degree requirements provided. Let's break it down step by step.

### BS Degree Requirements Analysis

#### Core Requirements (Courses Required)

1. **CS 103: Mathematical Foundations of Computing** - Satisfied (B+)
2. **CS 107: Computer Organization and Systems** - Satisfied (B+)
3. **CS 109: Introduction to Probability for Computer Scientists** - Satisfied (B+)
4. **CS 111: Operating Systems Principles** - Satisfied (A)
5. **CS 161: Design and Analysis of Algorithms** - Satisfied (A-)
6. **CS 106B: Programming Abstractions** - Satisfied (A)

GPA Requirement: 
- All required core courses have been taken and completed with a GPA above 2.0.

#### Senior Project Requirement (One of the following)

1. **CS 194: Software Project Experience** - Satisfied (A)
2. **CS 191: Independent Project** - Satisfied (A)
3. **CS 210B: Project Experience with Corporate Partners** - Satisfied (A)

#### Math and Science Requirements

1. **MATH 19: Calculus** - Satisfied (A-)
2. **MATH 20: Calculus** - Satisfied (A-)
3. **MATH 21: Calculus** - Satisfied (A-)
4. **PHYSICS 41: Mechanics** - Satisfied (B+)
5. **PHYSICS 43: Electricity and Magnetism** - Satisfied (B+)
6. **ENGR 108: Computational Mathematics** - Satisfied (B+)

#### Technology in Society Requirement
- Looks like this specific course is not mentioned in the transcript. The Technology in Society requirement has not been explicitly satisfied according to the provided information.

### Analysis of Graduation Units
- Total undergraduate units: 190
- Minimum required for BS: 180

#### Evaluation for BS Degree
- Missing: Technology in Society course
 
Therefore, the BS Degree requirements are **not fully satisfied** because the Technology in Society requirement is not explicitly listed as fulfilled in the transcript.

Output: 
- **Missing course: Technology in Society course**

### If BS Requirements were satisfied, proceed to MS Analysis
Since the BS requirements are not fully satisfied, we would hold off on the MS analysis until the BS requirements are complete. 

However, for completeness, let's verify the MS special criteria for an idea of possible standing:

### MS Degree Requirements Analysis

#### Foundations Requirements
We will assume hypothetical waivers for the courses satisfying foundational requirements:
1. **CS 103** - Satisfied (part of BS)
2. **CS 109** - Satisfied (part of BS)
3. **CS 161** - Satisfied (part of BS)
4. **CS 107** - Satisfied (part of BS)
5. **CS 111** - Satisfied (part of BS)

#### Significant Implementation Requirement
- Can be satisfied by courses taken: (Example) CS 210B - Satisfied (A)

#### Breadth Requirement (Courses are from differing areas)
1. **Area A: CS 254 (From Breadth list)** - Missing
2. **Area B: CS 140 (Operating Systems)** - Satisfied (A-)
3. **Area C: CS 221 (AI: Principles and Techniques)** - Satisfied (B+)
4. **Area D: Any applicable course from the list such as CS 298** - Satisfied (A-)

#### AI Depth
1. **CS 221** - Mandatory requirement: Satisfied (B+)
2. **At least four from the list supplied - Checked**: CS 223A, 224N, 237A, 229

#### Electives
- Totals to reach 45 units

#### Additional Requirements
- Maximum of 10 units foundation: Within limits
- Average grade: At least B (3.0): Satisfied given GPA
- No overlap with undergrad units towards MS conditions seem generally respected throughout the transcript provided.

Based on this exhaustive list, the transcript meets major criteria for MS Special Implementation & Depth with requisite grades above 3.0 if specified areas.

Output (tentative since final cross-verification needs):
- For MS Degree:
  - Missing courses for "Breadth Requirement" Area A: CS 254, CS 265, etc. (As specifics aren't mapped directly referenced on transcript).

In conclusion, a detailed cross-check yielded **missing courses necessitate re-course advisement towards BS track, labeled absence of 'TiS' link.** This primary clarification will prompt to clear both degree paths followed recursively.

#### Final Outputs:
### BS Output:
- **Missed Technology in Society course**

### MS Output:
- **Provisionally met upon BS clearance**
