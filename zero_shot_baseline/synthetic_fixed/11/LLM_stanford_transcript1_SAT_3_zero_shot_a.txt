### MS Specialization Requirement Analysis

To determine if Alexandra Marie Smith satisfies the MS requirements with an AI specialization, I need to consider:

1. **Foundations Requirement:**
   - **CS 103** - Completed during undergrad.
   - **CS 109** - Completed during undergrad.
   - **CS 107** - Completed during undergrad.
   - **CS 161** - Completed during undergrad.
   - **CS 111** - Completed during undergrad.

2. **Significant Implementation Requirement:**
   - **CS 221 AI: Principles and Techniques** also counts here - Completed, Grade: A-

3. **Breadth Requirements:**
   - **Area A:** (e.g., CS 154, CS 157, etc.) Not explicitly listed in the transcript.
   - **Area B:** (e.g., CS 140, CS 144, etc.) CS 111 can count here.
   - **Area C:** AI courses (many completed in undergrad: CS 221, CS 229, etc.)
   - **Area D:** (e.g., CS 152, CS 181, etc.) No courses listed in the transcript.

4. **Depth Requirement:**
   - **CS 221 AI: Principles and Techniques** - Completed, Grade: A-
   - **Four Courses from AI Area:**
     - **CS 224N** - Completed, Grade: B+
     - **CS 228** - Completed, Grade: B+
     - **CS 231A** - Completed, Grade: A
     - **CS 223A** - Completed, Grade: A
   - **Additional Units for AI Depth:**
     - **CS 234** - Completed, Grade: A
     - **CS 245** - Completed, Grade: B+
     - **CS 246** - Completed, Grade: A-
   
5. **Electives:**
   - **CS 257** - Completed, Grade: A
   - **CS 270** - Completed, Grade: A-
   - **CS 294** - Completed, Grade: A-
   - **CS 371** - Completed, Grade: A-

6. **Additional MS Degree Requirements:**
   - **At least 45 graduate units** (Only 5 MS units listed).
   - **GPA requirement met.**
   - **No double counting with undergraduate units.**
   - **Significant Implementation and Breadth courses fully specified.**

Note: Not enough MS-specific units are listed to confirm the MS requirement independently. Further feedback from the MS Program Administrator may be required.

**Output:** MS requirements not fully confirmed due to incomplete unit specification. Further information is needed from MS transcript.
