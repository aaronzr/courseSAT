Let's translate each of the provided contextual statements into CVC5 Python formulas. We'll start by defining the necessary Boolean variables and then translate each statement sentence by sentence. Lastly, we will setup and evaluate the test statement using the CVC5 SMT solver.

First, let's import CVC5 and define the variables for each animal and relation in the statements.

```python
import cvc5
from cvc5 import Kind

# Initialize solver
solver = cvc5.Solver()

# Define the Boolean variables for animals and relationships
likes = {}
eats = {}
chases = {}
is_ = {}

animals = ['bald_eagle', 'cow', 'squirrel', 'tiger']

for animal1 in animals:
    for animal2 in animals:
        if animal1 != animal2:
            likes[(animal1, animal2)] = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), f"likes_{animal1}_{animal2}")
            eats[(animal1, animal2)] = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), f"eats_{animal1}_{animal2}")
            chases[(animal1, animal2)] = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), f"chases_{animal1}_{animal2}")

for animal in animals:
    is_[animal] = {prop: solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), f"is_{animal}_{prop}") 
                   for prop in ["kind", "rough", "big", "blue", "round"]}

# Helper function to make implication
def implies(p, q):
    return solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, p, q)

# Contextual statements translations:

# 'If something likes the squirrel then it eats the squirrel.'
for animal in animals:
    solver.assertFormula(implies(likes[(animal, 'squirrel')], eats[(animal, 'squirrel')]))

# 'If the bald eagle likes the squirrel and the squirrel is kind then the squirrel is rough.'
solver.assertFormula(implies(
    solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, likes[('bald_eagle', 'squirrel')], is_['squirrel']['kind']), 
    is_['squirrel']['rough']
))

# 'If something likes the squirrel and the squirrel likes the cow then it is blue.'
for animal in animals:
    solver.assertFormula(implies(
        solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, likes[(animal, 'squirrel')], likes[('squirrel', 'cow')]), 
        is_[animal]['blue']
    ))

# 'If something eats the cow then it is big.'
for animal in animals:
    solver.assertFormula(implies(eats[(animal, 'cow')], is_[animal]['big']))

# 'If something eats the cow and it is big then the cow chases the bald eagle.'
for animal in animals:
    solver.assertFormula(implies(
        solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, eats[(animal, 'cow')], is_[animal]['big']), 
        chases[('cow', 'bald_eagle')]
    ))

# 'If something chases the squirrel then the squirrel likes the cow.'
for animal in animals:
    solver.assertFormula(implies(chases[(animal, 'squirrel')], likes[('squirrel', 'cow')]))

# 'If something chases the squirrel and the squirrel eats the tiger then it likes the squirrel.'
for animal in animals:
    solver.assertFormula(implies(
        solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, chases[(animal, 'squirrel')], eats[('squirrel', 'tiger')]), 
        likes[(animal, 'squirrel')]
    ))

# 'If something eats the squirrel then it eats the cow.'
for animal in animals:
    solver.assertFormula(implies(eats[(animal, 'squirrel')], eats[(animal, 'cow')]))

# 'If something is kind and it likes the cow then it is big.'
for animal in animals:
    solver.assertFormula(implies(
        solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, is_[animal]['kind'], likes[(animal, 'cow')]),
        is_[animal]['big']
    ))

# 'The bald eagle chases the cow.'
solver.assertFormula(chases[('bald_eagle', 'cow')])

# 'The bald eagle is round.'
solver.assertFormula(is_['bald_eagle']['round'])

# 'The cow chases the tiger.'
solver.assertFormula(chases[('cow', 'tiger')])

# 'The cow is blue.'
solver.assertFormula(is_['cow']['blue'])

# 'The cow is rough.'
solver.assertFormula(is_['cow']['rough'])

# 'The squirrel chases the bald eagle.'
solver.assertFormula(chases[('squirrel', 'bald_eagle')])

# 'The squirrel eats the bald eagle.'
solver.assertFormula(eats[('squirrel', 'bald_eagle')])

# 'The squirrel eats the tiger.'
solver.assertFormula(eats[('squirrel', 'tiger')])

# 'The squirrel likes the bald eagle.'
solver.assertFormula(likes[('squirrel', 'bald_eagle')])

# 'The squirrel likes the tiger.'
solver.assertFormula(likes[('squirrel', 'tiger')])

# 'The tiger chases the squirrel.'
solver.assertFormula(chases[('tiger', 'squirrel')])

# Test statement: 'The tiger is blue.'
test_statement = is_['tiger']['blue']
solver.assertFormula(test_statement)

# Check satisfiability
if solver.checkSat().isSat():
    print("The test statement 'The tiger is blue' is SATISFIED.")
else:
    print("The test statement 'The tiger is blue' is UNSATISFIED.")
```

This code sets up the CVC5 solver, defines the variables and relations, translates each sentence into corresponding CVC5 formulas, and finally checks the test statement 'The tiger is blue.'
