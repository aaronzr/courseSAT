We'll use the cvc5 Python bindings to define and evaluate the relevant constraints.

### Step-by-Step Translation

1. **If someone is cold and they like the tiger then the tiger does not like the lion.**

```python
# Import cvc5 and create a solver instance
import cvc5

solver = cvc5.Solver()

# Define sorts
Person = solver.mkUninterpretedSort('Person')
Animal = solver.mkUninterpretedSort('Animal')
Bool = solver.getBooleanSort()

# Define functions
is_cold = solver.mkFuncDecl('is_cold', [Person], Bool)
likes = solver.mkFuncDecl('likes', [Person, Animal], Bool)
chases = solver.mkFuncDecl('chases', [Person, Animal], Bool)
eats = solver.mkFuncDecl('eats', [Person, Animal], Bool)

# Define constants
tiger = solver.mkConst(Animal, 'tiger')
lion = solver.mkConst(Animal, 'lion')

# First contextual statement
# ∀x. is_cold(x) ∧ likes(x, tiger) -> ¬likes(tiger, lion)
Person_x = solver.mkVar(Person, 'x')
stmt1 = solver.mkForall([Person_x], solver.mkTerm(
    cvc5.Kind.IMPLIES,
    solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.AND, is_cold(Person_x), likes(Person_x, tiger)),
    solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.NOT, likes(tiger, lion))
))
solver.assert_formula(stmt1)
```

2. **If someone chases the tiger then the tiger likes the lion.**

```python
# ∀x. chases(x, tiger) -> likes(tiger, lion)
stmt2 = solver.mkForall([Person_x], solver.mkTerm(
    cvc5.Kind.IMPLIES,
    chases(Person_x, tiger),
    likes(tiger, lion)
))
solver.assert_formula(stmt2)
```

3. **If the tiger is cold then the tiger chases the rabbit.**

```python
# Define additional constants
rabbit = solver.mkConst(Animal, 'rabbit')

# is_cold(tiger) -> chases(tiger, rabbit)
stmt3 = solver.mkTerm(
    cvc5.Kind.IMPLIES,
    is_cold(tiger),
    chases(tiger, rabbit)
)
solver.assert_formula(stmt3)
```

4. **If the lion chases the cat then the cat chases the tiger.**

```python
# Define additional constants
cat = solver.mkConst(Animal, 'cat')

# chases(lion, cat) -> chases(cat, tiger)
stmt4 = solver.mkTerm(
    cvc5.Kind.IMPLIES,
    chases(lion, cat),
    chases(cat, tiger)
)
solver.assert_formula(stmt4)
```

5. **If someone eats the tiger then the tiger is cold.**

```python
# ∀x. eats(x, tiger) -> is_cold(tiger)
stmt5 = solver.mkForall([Person_x], solver.mkTerm(
    cvc5.Kind.IMPLIES,
    eats(Person_x, tiger),
    is_cold(tiger)
))
solver.assert_formula(stmt5)
```

6. **If someone is young then they chase the tiger.**

```python
# Define additional function
is_young = solver.mkFuncDecl('is_young', [Person], Bool)

# ∀x. is_young(x) -> chases(x, tiger)
stmt6 = solver.mkForall([Person_x], solver.mkTerm(
    cvc5.Kind.IMPLIES,
    is_young(Person_x),
    chases(Person_x, tiger)
))
solver.assert_formula(stmt6)
```

7. **If someone chases the tiger then the tiger does not like the rabbit.**

```python
# ∀x. chases(x, tiger) -> ¬likes(tiger, rabbit)
stmt7 = solver.mkForall([Person_x], solver.mkTerm(
    cvc5.Kind.IMPLIES,
    chases(Person_x, tiger),
    solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.NOT, likes(tiger, rabbit))
))
solver.assert_formula(stmt7)
```

8. **If the tiger likes the cat and the tiger chases the rabbit then the tiger is young.**

```python
# ∀x. likes(tiger, cat) ∧ chases(tiger, rabbit) -> is_young(tiger)
stmt8 = solver.mkTerm(
    cvc5.Kind.IMPLIES,
    solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.AND, likes(tiger, cat), chases(tiger, rabbit)),
    is_young(tiger)
)
solver.assert_formula(stmt8)
```

9. **If the lion is rough and the lion is not red then the lion does not like the rabbit.**

```python
# Define additional functions
is_rough = solver.mkFuncDecl('is_rough', [Animal], Bool)
is_red = solver.mkFuncDecl('is_red', [Animal], Bool)

# is_rough(lion) ∧ ¬is_red(lion) -> ¬likes(lion, rabbit)
stmt9 = solver.mkTerm(
    cvc5.Kind.IMPLIES,
    solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.AND, is_rough(lion), solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.NOT, is_red(lion))),
    solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.NOT, likes(lion, rabbit))
)
solver.assert_formula(stmt9)
```

10. **The cat eats the tiger.**

```python
# eats(cat, tiger)
stmt10 = eats(cat, tiger)
solver.assert_formula(stmt10)
```

11. **The cat likes the tiger.**

```python
# likes(cat, tiger)
stmt11 = likes(cat, tiger)
solver.assert_formula(stmt11)
```

12. **The lion likes the cat.**

```python
# likes(lion, cat)
stmt12 = likes(lion, cat)
solver.assert_formula(stmt12)
```

13. **The rabbit is red.**

```python
# is_red(rabbit)
stmt13 = is_red(rabbit)
solver.assert_formula(stmt13)
```

14. **The rabbit is not young.**

```python
# ¬is_young(rabbit)
stmt14 = solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.NOT, is_young(rabbit))
solver.assert_formula(stmt14)
```

15. **The rabbit likes the lion.**

```python
# likes(rabbit, lion)
stmt15 = likes(rabbit, lion)
solver.assert_formula(stmt15)
```

16. **The tiger likes the cat.**

```python
# likes(tiger, cat)
stmt16 = likes(tiger, cat)
solver.assert_formula(stmt16)
```

### Test Statement: "The cat does not like the tiger."

```python
# ¬likes(cat, tiger)
test_stmt = solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.NOT, likes(cat, tiger))

# Check satisfiability
solver.assert_formula(test_stmt)
result = solver.checkSat()
print(f"Test Statement is {'satisfied' if result.isSat() else 'not satisfied'}")
```
