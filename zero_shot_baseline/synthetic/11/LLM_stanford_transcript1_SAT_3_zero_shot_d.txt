Alexandra Marie Smith satisfies all the Bachelor of Science degree requirements.========================GPT Answer to Prompt Two Regarding MS Requirements====================
First, let's break down the Master's in Science (MS) degree requirements into categories and analyze whether Alexandra Marie Smith satisfied each requirement based on the provided transcript.

### Foundations Requirement
1. Logic, Automata & Complexity (CS103)
   - Grade: B, Units: 5 (Taken during undergraduate)
2. Probability (CS109, Stat116, CME106, MS&E220, or EE178)
   - CS 109 Intro to Probability for Computer Scientists
   - Grade: B+, Units: 5 (Taken during undergraduate)
3. Algorithmic Analysis (CS161)

*Total Units for Foundations*: 
- All requirements are satisfied, totaling 25 units (however, note only up to 10 units can count towards MS).

### Significant Implementation Requirement
- At least one course from the list taken for a letter grade that may be used to satisfy other requirements. The student has taken:
  - CS 221 AI: Principles and Techniques, Grade: A-, 3.00 units.

### Breadth Requirement
Must take 3 courses, each from different Breadth Areas (A, B, C, or D), for a letter grade:
1. **Area A (Mathematical and Theoretical Foundations)**:
   - CS 257 Logic and Automated Reasoning, Grade: A, 3.00 units.
2. **Area B (Computer Systems)**:
   - No applicable taken courses found in transcript.
3. **Area C (Applications)**:
   - CS 246 Mining Massive Data Sets, Grade: A-, 3.00 units.
4. **Area D (Computing and Society)**:
   - No applicable taken courses found in transcript.

*Breadth Requirement Analysis*: Not fully satisfied. Missing courses in Area B and D.

### Artificial Intelligence Depth
a) **CS 221 (required)**
   - Taken: CS 221 AI: Principles and Techniques, Grade: A, 3.00 units.

b) **At least four of:**
   - CS 224N Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning, Grade: B+, 3.00 units.
   - CS 223A Introduction to Robotics, Grade: A, 3.00 units.
   - CS 228 Machine Learning Theory, Grade: B+, 3.00 units.
   - CS 234 Reinforcement Learning, Grade: A, 3.00 units.

c) **Total of at least 21 units from (a), (b), and the following:**
   - CS 229 Machine Learning, Grade: B, 3.00 units.
   - CS 245 Database Systems Principles, Grade: B+, 3.00 units.
   - CS 231A Computer Vision: From 3D Reconstruction to Recognition, Grade: A, 3.00 units.
   - CS 257 Logic and Automated Reasoning, Grade: A, 3.00 units.
   - CS 270 Computational Genomics, Grade: A-, 3.00 units.
   - CS 371 Computational Neural Models, Grade: A-, 3.00 units.

*Total Units for Depth*: 30 units.

### Electives
- Already satisfied due to the total units beyond foundational and depth requirements summing up to at least 45 total units.

### Summary
The analysis reveals the following requirement gaps:
1. Breadth Requirement: Missing courses in Area B (Computer Systems) and Area D (Computing and Society).

### Output
Since not all requirements are satisfied, the output would be:

```
Not satisfied Breadth Requirement: Area B (Computer Systems) and Area D (Computing and Society)
```
