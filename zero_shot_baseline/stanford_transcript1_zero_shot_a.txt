### Analysis of BS Requirements Satification:
Based on the provided requirements and the student's unofficial transcript, here is the analysis for the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.

#### Core Requirements:
1. **CS 106B: Programming Abstractions**
   - Taken: CS 106B Programming Abstractions (Grade: B)
   
2. **CS 107: Computer Organization and Systems / or CS 107E: Computer Systems**
   - Not Taken: CS 107 is a required core course for BS in Computer Science but not found on the transcript.

3. **CS 111: Operating System Principles**
   - Not Taken: CS 111 is also a core course required but not found on the transcript.

4. **CS 103: Mathematical Foundations of Computing**
   - Not Taken: Required course, but not found on the transcript.

5. **CS 109: Introduction to Probability for Computer Scientists**
   - Taken equivalent: CME 106 Introduction to Probability and Statistics for Engineers (Grade: B+)

6. **CS 161: Design and Analysis of Algorithms**
   - Not Taken: CS 161 required but not found on the transcript.

#### Senior Project Requirements:
- No CS 194 or CS 194W or CS 210B or CS 191 or CS 191W courses were identified on the transcript.

#### Additional Major Requirements:
1. **Math and Science Requirements**:
   - Mathematics: CME 100, CME 102, CME 104 (In summary, this can fulfill part of the math 26 units requirement)
   - Science: PHYSICS 41, PHYSICS 43 (Science units partially satisfied toward the 11 units)
   
2. **Engineering Fundamentals**:
   - ENGR 40: Introductory Electronics (Grade: B+)

#### GPA Requirement:
- The required GPA for ENGR Fundamentals, CS Core, Depth, and Senior Project combination should be a minimum of 2.0. The student has overall UG Cum GPA: 3.649.

#### Technology in Society Requirement:
- Not explicitly listed whether completed, needs further details.

### Not Satisfied BS Requirements:
- CS 107: Computer Organization and Systems
- CS 111: Operating System Principles
- CS 103: Mathematical Foundations of Computing
- CS 161: Design and Analysis of Algorithms
- Missing Senior Project completion: CS 194/194W/210B/191/191W
- Technology in Society Requirement confirmation needed.

**BS Status: "BS NOT SATISFIED"**

### Analysis of MS Requirements Satification:
Let's review the provided MS specialization requirements versus the transcript information.

#### Significant Implementation Requirement:
- The student needs to have completed at least one implementation course as part of the MS program (none explicitly highlighted as taken from the list).
  
#### Breadth Requirement:
- The student needs three courses each from different Breadth Areas (A, B, C, or D):
  - Breadth fulfillment not detailed or found in the transcript directly for grading areas but let's assume:
    - EE 108A, EE 141 can only potentially be part of Breadth Area B.
  - Specific Breadth fulfillment and approval for directed studies or independent required.

#### Depth Requirement:
1. **CS 221**: Required - Needs confirmation if taken as depth related or equivalent coursework.
2. **Four of AI Depth Courses**: Insufficient detail - no direct equivalent found from transcript courses.
3. **Additional courses for total 21 units in Artificial Intelligence Depth**: Exact elective course requirement confirmation needed based on list.

#### Electives:
- Needs clarification towards 45-unit requirement completion for electives.

### Not Satisfied MS Requirements:
- Significant Implementation Course: No confirmation.
- Breadth Requirement (Three Courses, Separate): Specific courses need confirmation.
- Depth Units 21 fulfillment for Artificial Intelligence Depth: Not fully detailed enough.
- At least 45 graduate units at Stanford: Based from coursework review, especially courses with CR/S confirmed impact.
- Units applied for MSCS including Breadth, Depth, Elective courses clarity and approval.

**MS Status: "MS NOT SATISFIED"**

### Conclusion:
The current transcript data and course requirement clearly show there is missing coursework and explicit detail fulfillment information necessary before providing complete determination of satisfied state for both bachelor's and master's programs. 

**BS NOT SATISFIED**  
**MS NOT SATISFIED**
