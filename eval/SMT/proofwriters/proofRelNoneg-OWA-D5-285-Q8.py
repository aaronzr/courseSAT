The translations will involve creating variables and logical relationships as described by your sentences.

1. **Sentence**: "If something likes the lion then it chases the tiger."
   ```python
   from cvc5 import Solver, BoolSort, FunctionSort

   solver = Solver()
   Bool = solver.getBoolSort()
   
   likes = solver.mkFunction("likes", [solver.getSort("thing"), solver.getSort("thing")], Bool)
   chases = solver.mkFunction("chases", [solver.getSort("thing"), solver.getSort("thing")], Bool)
   
   x = solver.mkVar(solver.getSort("thing"), "x")
   y = solver.mkVar(solver.getSort("thing"), "y")

   sentence1 = solver.mkOr(solver.mkNot(likes(x, y)), chases(x, y))
   ```

2. **Sentence**: "If something is blue then it likes the lion."
   ```python
   is_blue = solver.mkFunction("is_blue", [solver.getSort("thing")], Bool)
   
   sentence2 = solver.mkOr(solver.mkNot(is_blue(x)), likes(x, y))
   ```

3. **Sentence**: "If something likes the mouse then the mouse is blue."
   ```python
   mouse = solver.mkConst(solver.getSort("thing"), "mouse")
   
   sentence3 = solver.mkOr(solver.mkNot(likes(x, mouse)), is_blue(mouse))
   ```

4. **Sentence**: "If something chases the lion then it is green."
   ```python
   lion = solver.mkConst(solver.getSort("thing"), "lion")
   is_green = solver.mkFunction("is_green", [solver.getSort("thing")], Bool)
   
   sentence4 = solver.mkOr(solver.mkNot(chases(x, lion)), is_green(x))
   ```

5. **Sentence**: "If the tiger is green then the tiger likes the lion."
   ```python
   tiger = solver.mkConst(solver.getSort("thing"), "tiger")
   
   sentence5 = solver.mkOr(solver.mkNot(is_green(tiger)), likes(tiger, lion))
   ```

6. **Sentence**: "If the mouse eats the cat and the mouse likes the tiger then the mouse likes the lion."
   ```python
   eats = solver.mkFunction("eats", [solver.getSort("thing"), solver.getSort("thing")], Bool)
   cat = solver.mkConst(solver.getSort("thing"), "cat")
   
   sentence6 = solver.mkOr(solver.mkNot(eats(mouse, cat)), solver.mkOr(solver.mkNot(likes(mouse, tiger)), likes(mouse, lion)))
   ```

7. **Sentence**: "If something chases the tiger then it is blue."
   ```python
   sentence7 = solver.mkOr(solver.mkNot(chases(x, tiger)), is_blue(x))
   ```

8. **Sentence**: "If something eats the lion and the lion is green then the lion is big."
   ```python
   is_big = solver.mkFunction("is_big", [solver.getSort("thing")], Bool)
   
   sentence8 = solver.mkOr(solver.mkNot(eats(x, lion)), solver.mkOr(solver.mkNot(is_green(lion)), is_big(lion)))
   ```

9. **Sentence**: "All green, blue things are big."
   ```python
   sentence9 = solver.mkImplies(solver.mkAnd(is_green(x), is_blue(x)), is_big(x))
   ```

10. **Sentence**: "The cat chases the mouse."
    ```python
    statement1 = chases(cat, mouse)
    ```

11. **Sentence**: "The cat is blue."
    ```python
    statement2 = is_blue(cat)
    ```

12. **Sentence**: "The lion chases the cat."
    ```python
    statement3 = chases(lion, cat)
    ```

13. **Sentence**: "The lion likes the cat."
    ```python
    statement4 = likes(lion, cat)
    ```

14. **Sentence**: "The mouse is young."
    ```python
    is_young = solver.mkFunction("is_young", [solver.getSort("thing")], Bool)
    
    statement5 = is_young(mouse)
    ```

15. **Sentence**: "The mouse likes the lion."
    ```python
    statement6 = likes(mouse, lion)
    ```

16. **Sentence**: "The tiger chases the cat."
    ```python
    statement7 = chases(tiger, cat)
    ```

17. **Sentence**: "The tiger chases the lion."
    ```python
    statement8 = chases(tiger, lion)
    ```

18. **Sentence**: "The tiger chases the mouse."
    ```python
    statement9 = chases(tiger, mouse)
    ```

19. **Sentence**: "The tiger likes the cat."
    ```python
    statement10 = likes(tiger, cat)
    ```

20. **Test Statement**: "The tiger does not chase the tiger."
    ```python
    test_statement = solver.mkNot(chases(tiger, tiger))
    ```

Finally, let's assemble the whole script and check the satisfiability of the test statement.

```python
from cvc5 import Solver, BoolSort, FunctionSort, Op

# Create solver instance
solver = Solver()
Bool = solver.getBoolSort()

solver.setOption("produce-models", "true")

# Declare sorts and constants
thing = solver.mkUninterpretedSort("thing")
likes = solver.mkFunction("likes", [thing, thing], Bool)
chases = solver.mkFunction("chases", [thing, thing], Bool)
is_blue = solver.mkFunction("is_blue", [thing], Bool)
is_green = solver.mkFunction("is_green", [thing], Bool)
is_big = solver.mkFunction("is_big", [thing], Bool)
eats = solver.mkFunction("eats", [thing, thing], Bool)
is_young = solver.mkFunction("is_young", [thing], Bool)

# Define constants for specific animals
lion = solver.mkConst(thing, "lion")
mouse = solver.mkConst(thing, "mouse")
cat = solver.mkConst(thing, "cat")
tiger = solver.mkConst(thing, "tiger")

x = solver.mkVar(thing, "x")

# Translate statements to formulas
sentence1 = solver.mkOr(solver.mkNot(likes(x, lion)), chases(x, tiger))
sentence2 = solver.mkOr(solver.mkNot(is_blue(x)), likes(x, lion))
sentence3 = solver.mkOr(solver.mkNot(likes(x, mouse)), is_blue(mouse))
sentence4 = solver.mkOr(solver.mkNot(chases(x, lion)), is_green(x))
sentence5 = solver.mkOr(solver.mkNot(is_green(tiger)), likes(tiger, lion))
sentence6 = solver.mkOr(solver.mkNot(eats(mouse, cat)), solver.mkOr(solver.mkNot(likes(mouse, tiger)), likes(mouse, lion)))
sentence7 = solver.mkOr(solver.mkNot(chases(x, tiger)), is_blue(x))
sentence8 = solver.mkOr(solver.mkNot(eats(x, lion)), solver.mkOr(solver.mkNot(is_green(lion)), is_big(lion)))
sentence9 = solver.mkImplies(solver.mkAnd(is_green(x), is_blue(x)), is_big(x))

statement1 = chases(cat, mouse)
statement2 = is_blue(cat)
statement3 = chases(lion, cat)
statement4 = likes(lion, cat)
statement5 = is_young(mouse)
statement6 = likes(mouse, lion)
statement7 = chases(tiger, cat)
statement8 = chases(tiger, lion)
statement9 = chases(tiger, mouse)
statement10 = likes(tiger, cat)

test_statement = solver.mkNot(chases(tiger, tiger))

# Add all assertions to the solver
solver.assertFormula(sentence1)
solver.assertFormula(sentence2)
solver.assertFormula(sentence3)
solver.assertFormula(sentence4)
solver.assertFormula(sentence5)
solver.assertFormula(sentence6)
solver.assertFormula(sentence7)
solver.assertFormula(sentence8)
solver.assertFormula(sentence9)
solver.assertFormula(statement1)
solver.assertFormula(statement2)
solver.assertFormula(statement3)
solver.assertFormula(statement4)
solver.assertFormula(statement5)
solver.assertFormula(statement6)
solver.assertFormula(statement7)
solver.assertFormula(statement8)
solver.assertFormula(statement9)
solver.assertFormula(statement10)
solver.assertFormula(test_statement)

# Check satisfiability
result = solver.checkSat()

print("Test Statement is:", result) # Expected output: unsat
```

The output of the final part should tell us whether the test statement "The tiger does not chase the tiger." is satisfied (`sat`) or not (`unsat`). If this logic works, you'll see that the test statement is `unsat`, as logically an animal not chasing itself should hold true based on the context.
