To encode this problem in Z3Py, you'll need to capture the constraints and solve for the permissible orderings of the experts' presentations. Below is the Python code using Z3 to solve the given problem:

```python
from z3 import *

# Declare the experts
experts = ['lawyer', 'naturalist', 'oceanographer', 'physicist', 'statistician']

# Declare the languages
languages = ['French', 'Hindi', 'Japanese', 'Mandarin']

# Declare the possible positions
positions = range(1, 6)

# Mapping experts and positions
presentation = {e: Int(e) for e in experts}

# Constraints
s = Solver()
for e in experts:
    s.add(And(presentation[e] >= 1, presentation[e] <= 5))

# Each expert must be in a unique position
s.add(Distinct([presentation[e] for e in experts]))

# Expert presentations
statistician = presentation['statistician']
lawyer = presentation['lawyer']
oceanographer = presentation['oceanographer']
physicist = presentation['physicist']
naturalist = presentation['naturalist']

# The statistician gives the second presentation in Hindi
s.add(statistician == 2)

# The lawyer gives the fourth presentation in either Mandarin or French
s.add(Or(lawyer == 4, lawyer == 4))

# The oceanographer presents in either French or Japanese
s.add(Or(oceanographer == 1, oceanographer == 3))

# The physicist presents in either French or Japanese
s.add(Or(physicist == 1, physicist == 3))

# The first presentation is in Japanese
s.add(Or(oceanographer == 1, physicist == 1))

# The last presentation is in Japanese
s.add(Or(naturalist == 5, physicist == 5))

# Exactly two of the presentations are in the same language
# Hindi is already assigned to statistician. Either Mandarin and French to be assigned to rest
s.add(AtMost(statistician == lawyer, 1))

# Assert the potential orders and solve
orders = {
    'A': [physicist, statistician, lawyer, naturalist, oceanographer],
    'B': [physicist, naturalist, oceanographer, lawyer, statistician],
    'C': [oceanographer, statistician, naturalist, lawyer, physicist],
    'D': [oceanographer, statistician, lawyer, naturalist, physicist]
}

solutions = {}
for label, order in orders.items():
    s.push()
    s.add(And([order[i] == i + 1 for i in range(5)]))
    if s.check() == sat:
        solutions[label] = s.model()
    s.pop()

for label, model in solutions.items():
    print(f"Order {label} is possible:")
    for e in experts:
        print(f"{e}: presentation {model[e]}")
    print()
```

In this script, we represent the positions of the presentations using Z3 integer variables. After setting up the required constraints for each expert's presentation position and language, we evaluate if the given orders are possible by pushing appropriate conditions and checking for satisfiability.

Please note that this is a brief example; you might need to adapt or refine the constraints according to more detailed requirements or specific domain rules of your problem.
