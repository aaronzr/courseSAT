        Your task is to generate cvc5 smt solver formulas for the constraints in each requirement ### FOUNDATIONS REQUIREMENT

You must satisfy the requirements listed in each of the following areas; all courses taken elsewhere must be approved by your adviser via the foundation course waiver form. Do not enter anything in the “Units” column for courses taken elsewhere or for Stanford courses counted towards your undergraduate degree.

Required | Equivalent elsewhere (course numbers/titles/institution) | Grade | Units
--- | --- | --- | ---
Logic, Automata & Complexity (CS103) |  |  | 
Probability (CS109, Stat116, CME106, MS&E220, or EE178) |  |  | 
Algorithmic Analysis (CS161) |  |  |

This code sets up constraints according to the given requirements:

1. **Required Foundation Courses**: Ensures that courses in logic, probability, algorithmic analysis, computer organization, and principles of computer systems are taken.
2. **Total Units Constraint**: Ensures the total units used to satisfy the Foundations Requirement do not exceed 10 units.
3. **Advisor Approval Constraint**: Ensures any deviation or courses taken elsewhere are approved by the advisor. 

The provided script should be extended to correctly map the actual data structure used in the system being tested and handle additional constraints (like AP credits or deviations). The total units calculation should also adapt to the actual transcripts, and the respective elements must be defined realistically.
