==================================================================GPT Answer to Prompt One Regarding BS Requirements====================
To determine if Emily Ann Berkowitz has satisfied the Bachelor of Science (BS) degree requirements in Computer Science at Stanford University, we need to compare her transcript with the university's stated requirements. These include BS core requirements, senior project requirements, AI elective requirements, and general credits and GPA requirements.

### BS Core Requirements (Courses and Units):
- **CS 106B: Programming Abstractions**
    - Taken: Autumn 2012-2013 (Grade B)
- **CS 107 or CS107E: Computer Organization and Systems**
    - Taken CS 107E: Winter 2013-2014 (Grade A)
- **CS 111: Principles of Computer Systems (Formerly CS 110)**
    - Taken as CS 110: Spring 2012-2013 (Grade A)
- **CS 103: Mathematical Foundations of Computing**
    - Not explicitly listed in the transcript
- **CS 109: Introduction to Probability for Computer Scientists**
    - Taken: Winter 2012-2013 (Grade B+)
- **CS 161: Design and Analysis of Algorithms**
    - Taken: Autumn 2013-2014 (Grade B+)

### Required Senior Project (One Course):
- **CS 191W: Independent Project Writing Intensive**
    - Taken: Winter 2013-2014 (Grade A)

### AI Track Core, Depth and Electives:
- **CS 221: AI: Principles and Techniques**
    - Taken: Winter 2013-2014 (Grade A)
- **Two courses from different areas (Track Requirement B):**
    - CS 229: Machine Learning (AI Methods): Winter 2013-2014 (Grade A-)
    - CS 131: Computer Vision (Vision): Winter 2013-2014 (Grade A)
- **One additional course from the Track Requirement B list (Track Requirement C):**
    - CS 225A: Robotics Principles & Practice (Robotics): Spring 2013-2014 (Grade A-)
- **Three additional electives:**
    - CS 224N: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning (NLP): Autumn 2014-2015 (Grade A)
    - CS 237A: Robotics: AI Techniques and Applications (Robotics): Autumn 2014-2015 (Grade A)
    - CS 228: Computer Vision (AI Methods): Autumn 2014-2015 (Grade B+)

### Additional General Requirements:
- **Mathematics Requirements (26 units)**
    - CME 100, CME 102, CME 104, CS 109: Total Units = 17 (MATH19/20/21 with 10 AP units covers general Math requirements)
- **Science Requirements (11 units)**
    - PHYSICS 41, PHYSICS 43, and Elective not detailed: Total Units = 8 (unsatisfied)
- **Engineering Fundamentals (10 units minimum)**
    - CS 106B (5 units), ENGR 40 (5 units): Total Units = 10 (satisfied)
- **Technology in Society Requirement:** Not detailed in transcript

### GPA Requirement:
- **Minimum GPA of 2.0 in ENGR Fundamentals, CS Core, Depth, and Senior Project** (combined)
    - Overall GPA: 3.659 (satisfied)

### Conclusion:
The student transcript meets most of the requirements but **lacks demonstrable completion of the CS 103: Mathematical Foundations of Computing course** and **one additional 3-unit science elective**.

### Output:
List of courses not satisfied:
1. CS 103: Mathematical Foundations of Computing
2. One additional 3-unit science elective to meet the 11 units minimum requirement.

Thus, the output for the given student's status would be:

```
CS 103, Science elective (3 units)
```========================GPT Answer to Prompt Two Regarding MS Requirements====================
To determine whether Emily Ann Berkowitz satisfies the MS in Computer Science degree requirements with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence at Stanford, we need to assess her transcript against the requirements specified.

### 1. Foundations Requirement
- Logic, Automata & Complexity (CS103): Not taken or listed.
- Probability (CS109, Stat116, CME106, MS&E220, or EE178):
  - CS 109: Taken, Grade B+
- Algorithmic Analysis (CS161): Taken, Grade B+
- Computer Organ & Sys (CS107 or 107E): Taken, CS 107E, Grade A
- Principles of Computer Systems (CS110 or CS111): Taken, CS110, Grade A

**Status:**
- Remaining Course: CS103 (Logic, Automata & Complexity)

### 2. Significant Implementation Requirement
- One course satisfying this:
  - CS 248 (Interactive Computer Graphics): Taken, Grade B+

**Status:**
- Requirement met (CS 248 is in the list provided).

### 3. Breadth Requirement
- Three courses, each from a different Breadth area (A, B, C, or D):
  - A: Not listed.
  - B: Not listed.
  - C: CS 148 (Interactive Computer Graphics): Taken, Grade B+
  - D: MS&E 193 (Technology and National Security): Taken, Grade A-

**Status:**
- Remaining Analytical courses: One from Area A, one from Area B, and fulfilled Area D by MS&E 193.

### 4. Artificial Intelligence Depth Requirement
- CS 221: Taken, Grade A
- At least four of specific courses:
  - CS 223A: Taken, Grade A-
  - CS 224N: Taken, Grade A
  - CS 228: Taken, Grade B+
  - CS 231N: Taken, Grade A
  - CS 237A: Taken, Grade A
- Total of at least 21 units from categories (a), (b), and additional specified courses:
  - CS 229: Taken, Grade A- 
  - CS 225A: Taken, Grade A-
  - CS 229M: Taken, Grade A
  - CS 233: Taken, Grade A-
  - CS 248: Taken, Grade B+
  - CS 294: Taken, Grade A-
  - CS 236, CS 340 (Attempted but not completed)

**Total Units Counted Towards Depth: 3+4(CS 221)+15(courses from above)=22 (minimum 21 units requirement met).**

### 5. Electives
- Need to complete the remaining units to reach 45 units total for MSCS degree.
- Courses like CS 236, CS 340 were attempted but not completed this term.
- The completions of other courses fulfilled depth (as they count towards both).

**Status:**
- Total Graduate Units towards MS: 29 units completed. Need additional units to complete the total requirement of 45 units.

**Additional Notes:**
- Grades averaged to be at least a B (3.0 GPA) for satisfactory, and her cum GPA is 3.780, indicating satisfactory.
- All counted depth courses are taken for a letter grade.
  
### Summary
Based on the analysis, the following requirements were not fully satisfied:

- Logic, Automata & Complexity (CS103)
- One Breadth course from Area A (Mathematical and Theoretical Foundations)
- One Breadth course from Area B (Computer Systems)
- Total of 16 additional graduate units required to meet the 45-unit requirement for MS.

**Output:**
```
Courses not satisfied:
- Logic, Automata & Complexity (CS103)
- Breadth Area A
- Breadth Area B
- Total of 16 additional graduate units
```
