Certainly! Let's break down each sentence and translate them into CVC5 SMT formulas using Python. 

```python
import cvc5
from cvc5 import Kind

# Initializing the solver
solver = cvc5.Solver()

# Setting the logic
solver.setLogic("ALL")

# Declaring the types and variables
Person = solver.getUninterpretedSort("Person")
blue = solver.mkFunction("blue", Person, solver.getBooleanSort())
young = solver.mkFunction("young", Person, solver.getBooleanSort())
cold = solver.mkFunction("cold", Person, solver.getBooleanSort())
nice = solver.mkFunction("nice", Person, solver.getBooleanSort())
kind = solver.mkFunction("kind", Person, solver.getBooleanSort())
quiet = solver.mkFunction("quiet", Person, solver.getBooleanSort())
furry = solver.mkFunction("furry", Person, solver.getBooleanSort())

# Declaring individuals
Gary = solver.mkConst(Person, "Gary")
Erin = solver.mkConst(Person, "Erin")
Dave = solver.mkConst(Person, "Dave")
Fiona = solver.mkConst(Person, "Fiona")

# Translating contextual statements into SMT formulas

# Blue people are young.
x = solver.mkVar(Person, "x")
stmt1 = solver.mkForall(x, solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, blue(x), young(x)))

# If someone is cold and nice then they are kind.
stmt2 = solver.mkForall(x, solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, cold(x), nice(x)), kind(x)))

# All quiet people are nice.
stmt3 = solver.mkForall(x, solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, quiet(x), nice(x)))

# If someone is kind and quiet then they are cold.
stmt4 = solver.mkForall(x, solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, kind(x), quiet(x)), cold(x)))

# If Gary is quiet and Gary is furry then Gary is cold.
stmt5 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, quiet(Gary), furry(Gary)), cold(Gary))

# If Erin is blue and Erin is young then Erin is nice.
stmt6 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, blue(Erin), young(Erin)), nice(Erin))

# Furry people are quiet.
stmt7 = solver.mkForall(x, solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, furry(x), quiet(x)))

# All kind, cold people are blue.
stmt8 = solver.mkForall(x, solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, kind(x), cold(x)), blue(x)))

# If Erin is furry then Erin is kind.
stmt9 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, furry(Erin), kind(Erin))

# Dave is cold.
stmt10 = cold(Dave)

# Dave is furry.
stmt11 = furry(Dave)

# Dave is nice.
stmt12 = nice(Dave)

# Dave is young.
stmt13 = young(Dave)

# Erin is cold.
stmt14 = cold(Erin)

# Erin is furry.
stmt15 = furry(Erin)

# Erin is nice.
stmt16 = nice(Erin)

# Erin is young.
stmt17 = young(Erin)

# Fiona is cold.
stmt18 = cold(Fiona)

# Fiona is furry.
stmt19 = furry(Fiona)

# Fiona is kind.
stmt20 = kind(Fiona)

# Fiona is nice.
stmt21 = nice(Fiona)

# Fiona is quiet.
stmt22 = quiet(Fiona)

# Fiona is young.
stmt23 = young(Fiona)

# Gary is furry.
stmt24 = furry(Gary)

# Gary is nice.
stmt25 = nice(Gary)

# Adding the statements to the solver
stmt_list = [stmt1, stmt2, stmt3, stmt4, stmt5, stmt6, stmt7, stmt8, stmt9, stmt10, stmt11, stmt12, stmt13, stmt14, stmt15, stmt16, stmt17, stmt18, stmt19, stmt20, stmt21, stmt22, stmt23, stmt24, stmt25]
for stmt in stmt_list:
    solver.assertFormula(stmt)

# Test statement: Fiona is not blue.
test_stmt = solver.mkTerm(Kind.NOT, blue(Fiona))

solver.assertFormula(test_stmt)

# Checking the satisfiability
result = solver.checkSat()

print(f"The test statement is: {result}")
```

In the code above:
- We initialize the CVC5 solver and set the logic.
- We define uninterpreted sorts and predicates for the attributes like `blue`, `young`, `cold`, etc.
- We declare constants (individuals) for Gary, Erin, Dave, and Fiona.
- We translate each natural language statement into an SMT formula.
- Finally, we add all contextual statements to the solver and check the satisfiability of the test statement "Fiona is not blue".

You can run this code to determine if the statement "Fiona is not blue" is satisfied given the above context.
