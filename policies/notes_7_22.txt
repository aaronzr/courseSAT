Fixed transcript: 
TODO: verbalize
    
        verbalize the unsat constraints in naatural language

        re-define the varables to be meaningful

        or give the definitions of the variables to GPT 

        Just given the terminologies and defined formulas; 

        Ask GPT to articulate the formulas

Do not ask GPT to compute which natural language requirement is unsat 

What not do do: 
        pick up the exampels that look easy but fail using GPT 
        at the last step, when we use GPT to think 

Maybe TODO:
        are they disjoint constraints? - are they all AND/OR constraints? 

HW:
        in  the case of unsat, partitioning set of requirements/constraints
        I need to satisfy "implementaton requiirements with 4 units"
        if you take 3, it doesn't satisfy...

        some courses you can take for both 3 or 4 units. 

Second_part (proposal transcript)

If you change the value of variable i.e. v1, the rest should be re-evuated 
concretizing sub-constraints 

        unsat(v1): if you set v1 to a concrete value, does it know if v1 
        is related to a specific constraint? 

        sum(v1, v2, v3, v4...)
        fixed variables v. choice variables 

        the concept of fixed variables, assigned unknowns, the cause, and the fixes 


Things worth writing about: 
- Database retreval
- explaining unsat: just verbalize 
- seprating fixed v.s. assigned variaables 
        offering suggestions 
- revise given varables to satify user preferences (conversations)
