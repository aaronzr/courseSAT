Alright, let's translate each statement into a CVC5 SMT formula using the CVC5 python API. First, we need to define the properties and entities, and then we will translate the contextual statements and the test statement.

```python
import cvc5
from cvc5 import Kind

solver = cvc5.Solver()

# Define sorts for entities and properties
Entity = solver.mkUninterpretedSort("Entity")
Property = solver.mkUninterpretedSort("Property")

# Define properties
white = solver.mkConst(solver.mkBooleanSort(), "white")
kind = solver.mkConst(solver.mkBooleanSort(), "kind")
smart = solver.mkConst(solver.mkBooleanSort(), "smart")
quiet = solver.mkConst(solver.mkBooleanSort(), "quiet")
nice = solver.mkConst(solver.mkBooleanSort(), "nice")
green = solver.mkConst(solver.mkBooleanSort(), "green")
red = solver.mkConst(solver.mkBooleanSort(), "red")

# Define individuals
Bob = solver.mkConst(Entity, "Bob")
Dave = solver.mkConst(Entity, "Dave")
Fiona = solver.mkConst(Entity, "Fiona")
Gary = solver.mkConst(Entity, "Gary")

# Define the contextual statements as implications using CVC5 formulas

# If something is white then it is kind.
white_kind = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, white, kind)

# All white, smart things are kind.
white_smart_kind = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, white, smart), kind)

# If something is quiet then it is white.
quiet_white = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, quiet, white)

# Kind things are nice.
kind_nice = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, kind, nice)

# Green, white things are red.
green_white_red = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, green, white), red)

# All smart, red things are nice.
smart_red_nice = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, smart, red), nice)

# If something is green and nice then it is quiet.
green_nice_quiet = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, green, nice), quiet)

# All nice things are green.
nice_green = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, nice, green)

# Define facts about individuals

# Bob is green.
bob_green = solver.mkTerm(Kind.EQUAL, green, solver.mkTrue())

# Bob is nice.
bob_nice = solver.mkTerm(Kind.EQUAL, nice, solver.mkTrue())

# Bob is red.
bob_red = solver.mkTerm(Kind.EQUAL, red, solver.mkTrue())

# Dave is red.
dave_red = solver.mkTerm(Kind.EQUAL, red, solver.mkTrue())

# Dave is smart.
dave_smart = solver.mkTerm(Kind.EQUAL, smart, solver.mkTrue())

# Fiona is green.
fiona_green = solver.mkTerm(Kind.EQUAL, green, solver.mkTrue())

# Fiona is nice.
fiona_nice = solver.mkTerm(Kind.EQUAL, nice, solver.mkTrue())

# Fiona is quiet.
fiona_quiet = solver.mkTerm(Kind.EQUAL, quiet, solver.mkTrue())

# Fiona is white.
fiona_white = solver.mkTerm(Kind.EQUAL, white, solver.mkTrue())

# Gary is white.
gary_white = solver.mkTerm(Kind.EQUAL, white, solver.mkTrue())

# Define the test statement: Fiona is not green.
test_statement = solver.mkTerm(Kind.NOT, fiona_green)

# Add all constraints to the solver
constraints = [
    white_kind, 
    white_smart_kind, 
    quiet_white, 
    kind_nice, 
    green_white_red, 
    smart_red_nice, 
    green_nice_quiet, 
    nice_green, 
    bob_green, 
    bob_nice, 
    bob_red, 
    dave_red, 
    dave_smart, 
    fiona_green, 
    fiona_nice, 
    fiona_quiet, 
    fiona_white, 
    gary_white
]

for constraint in constraints:
    solver.assertFormula(constraint)

solver.assertFormula(test_statement)

# Check the sat status
result = solver.checkSat()
print("The result of the test statement 'Fiona is not green.' is:", result)
```

Explanation:
- We defined properties (`white`, `kind`, etc.) and individuals (`Bob`, `Dave`, `Fiona`, `Gary`).
- The contextual statements are translated into implications.
- Statements about individuals are translated into simple equalities or assignments.
- The test statement (`Fiona is not green`) is asserted to the solver.
- Finally, the solver checks the satisfiability of the test statement.

Running the provided code will output whether the test statement `'Fiona is not green.'` is `satisfiable` or `unsatisfiable` given the constraints provided.
