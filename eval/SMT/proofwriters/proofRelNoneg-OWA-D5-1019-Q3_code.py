To translate each sentence into a CVC5 SMT formula, we first need to identify and define the necessary predicates and constants. Let's assume the following predicates and constants:

- Constants: bear, cow, rabbit, squirrel
- Predicates:
  - young(X)
  - needs(X, Y)
  - visits(X, Y)
  - big(X)
  - rough(X)
  - eats(X, Y)
  - cold(X)

I'll translate the sentences one by one. 

```python
import cvc5
from cvc5 import Solver, Term

# Initialize the solver
solver = Solver()
solver.setLogic("QF_UF") # Quantifier-free Uninterpreted Functions logic

# Sorts for our constants and predicates
animal = solver.mkUninterpretedSort("Animal")

# Declare constants
bear = solver.mkConst(animal, "bear")
cow = solver.mkConst(animal, "cow")
rabbit = solver.mkConst(animal, "rabbit")
squirrel = solver.mkConst(animal, "squirrel")

# Declare predicates
young = solver.mkPredicate([animal])
needs = solver.mkPredicate([animal, animal])
visits = solver.mkPredicate([animal, animal])
big = solver.mkPredicate([animal])
rough = solver.mkPredicate([animal])
eats = solver.mkPredicate([animal, animal])
cold = solver.mkPredicate([animal])

# Translate each statement
stmt1 = solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.IMPLIES, 
                     young(bear), 
                     needs(bear, squirrel))

stmt2 = solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.IMPLIES, 
                     solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.AND, 
                                   needs(bear, bear), 
                                   needs(bear, rabbit)), 
                     visits(bear, cow))

stmt3 = solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.IMPLIES, 
                     solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.AND, 
                                   big(cow), 
                                   needs(cow, rabbit)), 
                     rough(cow))

stmt4 = solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.IMPLIES, 
                     visits(bear, cow), 
                     rough(bear))

stmt5 = solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.IMPLIES, 
                     rough(bear), 
                     eats(bear, cow))

stmt6 = solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.IMPLIES, 
                     solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.AND, 
                                   visits(bear, cow), 
                                   rough(bear)), 
                     needs(bear, bear))

stmt7 = solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.IMPLIES, 
                     solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.AND, 
                                   needs(squirrel, bear), 
                                   eats(squirrel, cow)), 
                     cold(squirrel))

stmt8 = solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.IMPLIES, 
                     needs(bear, bear), 
                     needs(bear, rabbit))

stmt9 = eats(bear, squirrel)

stmt10 = young(bear)

stmt11 = visits(bear, rabbit)

stmt12 = eats(cow, rabbit)

stmt13 = visits(cow, rabbit)

stmt14 = visits(cow, squirrel)

stmt15 = needs(rabbit, cow)

stmt16 = visits(rabbit, bear)

stmt17 = visits(rabbit, squirrel)

stmt18 = big(squirrel)

stmt19 = cold(squirrel)

stmt20 = visits(squirrel, bear)

stmt21 = visits(squirrel, cow)

stmt22 = visits(squirrel, rabbit)

# Now the test statement
test_stmt = needs(bear, squirrel)

# Assert all translated expressions to the solver
solver_assertions = [stmt1, stmt2, stmt3, stmt4, stmt5, stmt6, stmt7, stmt8, stmt9, stmt10, stmt11, stmt12, stmt13, stmt14, stmt15, stmt16, stmt17, stmt18, stmt19, stmt20, stmt21, stmt22]
for assertion in solver_assertions:
    solver.assertFormula(assertion)

# Assert the negation of the test statement to check for satisfiability
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Kind.NOT, test_stmt))

# Check satisfiability
result = solver.checkSat()
print("The test statement is:", "unsatisfied" if result.isUnsat() else "satisfied")
```
The above code converts the contextual statements into CVC5 SMT formulas using Python and checks whether the given test statement "The bear needs the squirrel." is satisfied or not. The assertions are made to the solver, and the result is evaluated.

You need to make sure you have the CVC5 Python API installed in your environment to run this code. If deemed necessary you can then refine these predicates or constants as per actual program constraints.
