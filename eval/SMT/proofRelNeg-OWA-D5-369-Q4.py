['If someone likes the tiger then they are cold.', 'If someone chases the dog then the dog is not kind.', 'If the dog likes the cow and the cow likes the dog then the dog is cold.', 'If someone is cold then they like the cat.', 'If the cow is big and the cow likes the cat then the cat needs the dog.', 'If the tiger is kind and the tiger needs the cat then the cat needs the dog.', 'If someone is nice then they chase the tiger.', 'If someone needs the dog and they like the tiger then the dog is nice.', 'If someone chases the cow then the cow is big.', 'The cat does not chase the tiger.', 'The cat is big.', 'The cat likes the tiger.', 'The cow chases the cat.', 'The cow likes the tiger.', 'The cow needs the tiger.', 'The dog chases the cow.', 'The dog is kind.', 'The dog likes the cow.', 'The tiger is nice.', 'The tiger is young.', 'The tiger likes the cat.', 'The tiger does not like the dog.', 'The tiger does not need the cat.']The cat is not cold.To translate the contextual statements and the test statement into CVC5 SMT python formulas, we first need to identify the involved parameters. Specifically, we have `cat`, `dog`, `cow`, `tiger`, and various predicates such as `likes`, `chases`, `isKind`, `isCold`, `isBig`, `needs`, `isNice`, and `isYoung`.

We'll translate each sentence individually and then combine them into a CVC5 SMT solver script in Python. First, let's translate each of the sentences.

### Contextual Statements
1. If someone likes the tiger, then they are cold.
2. If someone chases the dog, then the dog is not kind.
3. If the dog likes the cow and the cow likes the dog, then the dog is cold.
4. If someone is cold, then they like the cat.
5. If the cow is big and the cow likes the cat, then the cat needs the dog.
6. If the tiger is kind and the tiger needs the cat, then the cat needs the dog.
7. If someone is nice, then they chase the tiger.
8. If someone needs the dog and they like the tiger, then the dog is nice.
9. If someone chases the cow, then the cow is big.
10. The cat does not chase the tiger.
11. The cat is big.
12. The cat likes the tiger.
13. The cow chases the cat.
14. The cow likes the tiger.
15. The cow needs the tiger.
16. The dog chases the cow.
17. The dog is kind.
18. The dog likes the cow.
19. The tiger is nice.
20. The tiger is young.
21. The tiger likes the cat.
22. The tiger does not like the dog.
23. The tiger does not need the cat.
24. The cat is not cold. (Test Statement)

Now let's encode these into a script. 

Here's the translation using the Python bindings for CVC5:

```python
import cvc5

# Create a solver instance
solver = cvc5.Solver()

# Create sorts
Animal = solver.mkUninterpretedSort("Animal")
Bool = solver.getBooleanSort()

# Create animal constants
cat = solver.mkConst(Animal, "cat")
dog = solver.mkConst(Animal, "dog")
cow = solver.mkConst(Animal, "cow")
tiger = solver.mkConst(Animal, "tiger")

# Create predicates
likes = solver.mkExpressionClass(cvc5.kinds.FunctionType, [Animal, Animal], Bool)
chases = solver.mkExpressionClass(cvc5.kinds.FunctionType, [Animal, Animal], Bool)
isKind = solver.mkExpressionClass(cvc5.kinds.FunctionType, [Animal], Bool)
isCold = solver.mkExpressionClass(cvc5.kinds.FunctionType, [Animal], Bool)
isBig = solver.mkExpressionClass(cvc5.kinds.FunctionType, [Animal], Bool)
needs = solver.mkExpressionClass(cvc5.kinds.FunctionType, [Animal, Animal], Bool)
isNice = solver.mkExpressionClass(cvc5.kinds.FunctionType, [Animal], Bool)
isYoung = solver.mkExpressionClass(cvc5.kinds.FunctionType, [Animal], Bool)

# Contextual statements
formulas = [
    solver.mkImplies(solver.mkExpr(cvc5.kinds.ApplyUf, likes, x, tiger), solver.mkExpr(cvc5.kinds.ApplyUf, isCold, x)) for x in [cat, dog, cow, tiger]

      solver.mkImplies(solver.mkExpr(cvc5.kinds.ApplyUf, isCold, x), solver.mkExpr(cvc5.kinds.ApplyUf, likes, x, cat)) for x in [cat, dog, cow, tiger]
] + [solver.mkImplies(solver.mkAnd(solver.mkExpr(cvc5.kinds.ApplyUf, isBig, cow), solver.mkExpr(cvc5.kinds.ApplyUf, likes, cow, cat)), solver.mkExpr(cvc5.kinds.ApplyUf, needs, cat, dog)),

      solver.mkImplies(solver.mkExpr(cvc5.kinds.ApplyUf, isNice, x), solver.mkExpr(cvc5.kinds.ApplyUf, chases, x, tiger)) for x in [cat, dog, cow, tiger]
] + [solver.mkImplies(solver.mkAnd(solver.mkExpr(cvc5.kinds.ApplyUf, needs, x, dog), solver.mkExpr(cvc5.kinds.ApplyUf, likes, x, tiger)), solver.mkExpr(cvc5.kinds.ApplyUf, isNice, dog)) for x in [cat, dog, cow, tiger]
] + [solver.mkImplies(solver.mkExpr(cvc5.kinds.ApplyUf, chases, x, cow), solver.mkExpr(cvc5.kinds.ApplyUf, isBig, cow)) for x in [cat, dog, cow, tiger]
] + [solver.mkNot(solver.mkExpr(cvc5.kinds.ApplyUf, chases, cat, tiger)),
     solver.mkExpr(cvc5.kinds.ApplyUf, isBig, cat),
     solver.mkExpr(cvc5.kinds.ApplyUf, likes, cat, tiger),

     solver.mkExpr(cvc5.kinds.ApplyUf, isYoung, tiger),
     solver.mkExpr(cvc5.kinds.ApplyUf, likes, tiger, cat),
     solver.mkNot(solver.mkExpr(cvc5.kinds.ApplyUf, likes, tiger, dog)),
     solver.mkNot(solver.mkExpr(cvc5.kinds.ApplyUf, needs, tiger, cat))
]

# Add the formulas to the solver
for formula in formulas:
    solver.assertFormula(formula)

# Add the negation of the test statement as the assertion to prove
test_statement = solver.mkNot(solver.mkExpr(cvc5.kinds.ApplyUf, isCold, cat))
solver.assertFormula(test_statement)

# Check for satisfiability
result = solver.checkSat()
print(f"Result of the test statement: {result}")
```

### Explanation

- We create constants for the animals: `cat`, `dog`, `cow`, and `tiger`.
- We define unary and binary predicates such as `likes`, `chases`, `isKind`, `isCold`, etc.
- We create a list of formulas based on the contextual sentences using these predicates.
- The test statement `The cat is not cold` is translated as an assertion to disprove (i.e., prove the negation).
- We use the CVC5 SMT solver to check the satisfiability of this setup and print the result. The result will tell us if the `cat` can be `not cold` given the constraints.
