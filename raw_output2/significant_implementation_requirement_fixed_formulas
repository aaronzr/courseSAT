        Please optimize your generated solver formulas by minimizing the use of
        for loops or if condition checks. The following example is an okay format, because we use a variable in the formula
        to parameterize the formulas as input to the solver: 
        ```python
        variable = solver.mkConst(solver.getStringSort(), "course")
        constraint_1 = [solver.mkTerm(Kind.EQUAL, solver.mkString(course.get("Course_ID")), solver.mkString(variable)) for course in transcript.get("Courses_Taken", [])]
        constraint_2 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.EQUAL, solver.mkString(variable), solver.mkString("CS 221"))
        formula = solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, constraint_1, constraint_2)
        ```
        The following example is NOT an okay format, because the formula is using hard coded values and is NOT parameterized: 
        ```python 
        for course in transcript.get("Courses_Taken", []):
                cs_221 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.EQUAL, solver.mkString(course.get("Course_ID")), solver.mkString("CS 221"))
        ```
        Please check the following out and convert for loops and if conditional checks into 
        solver formulas when possible: =======================prompt===========================

        When generating cvc5 solver formulas, please instantiate new variables to check the transcript schema against each constraint in the SIGNIFICANT IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENT. You should also include
        solver formulas for advisor approval and deviation constraints if there is one. Please generate
        formulas with respect to the requirements only.

Below, I'll generate cvc5 solver formulas for the "Significant Implementation Requirement" constraint specified. This includes handling advisor approval and deviations, as well as ensuring at least one course meets the graded and course list requirements.

Here are the cvc5 solver formulas:

### Explanation

1. **Significant Course Check**:
    - We first define variables to represent the attributes (`significant_course`, `significant_course_grade`, `significant_course_stanford`).
    - We create constraints to ensure the significant course is on the approved courses list.
      
2. **Transcript and Grade Check**:
    - Constraints to ensure the course is in the transcript, taken for a letter grade, and taken at Stanford.

3. **Coterm Waiver Check**:
    - If the student is a coterm and has taken 2 significant courses as an undergrad, they might be exempted.

4. **Deviation Approval Check**:
    - We check deviations are approved by Cynthia Lee.

5. **Advisor Approval Check**:
    - Ensure any necessary approvals by the advisor are present.

6. **Combine All Constraints**:
    - Finally, we consolidate all constraints into a single formula and check its satisfiability with the solver.

These formulas handle the constraints without using loops or hardcoded conditionals, making them suitable for solver input.
