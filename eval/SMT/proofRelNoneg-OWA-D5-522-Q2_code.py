The task here is to convert a series of contextual natural language statements into logical SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) formulas using cvc5 in Python. These SMT formulas are then utilized to evaluate the test statement. Let's begin by translating each of these statements into cvc5 SMT formulas.

First, we will create the required setup and the symbols.

```python
import cvc5
from cvc5 import Kind

# Create an SMT solver
solver = cvc5.Solver()

# Declare the boolean sorts and sorts for our objects
Bool = solver.getBooleanSort()
Object = solver.getUninterpretedSort('Object')

# Declare the objects involved
bear = solver.mkConst(Object, 'bear')
dog = solver.mkConst(Object, 'dog')
rabbit = solver.mkConst(Object, 'rabbit')
tiger = solver.mkConst(Object, 'tiger')

# Declare predicates
eats = solver.mkPredicate(Object, Object, 'eats')
likes = solver.mkPredicate(Object, Object, 'likes')
sees = solver.mkPredicate(Object, Object, 'sees')
is_green = solver.mkPredicate(Object, 'is_green')
is_big = solver.mkPredicate(Object, 'is_big')
is_red = solver.mkPredicate(Object, 'is_red')
is_rough = solver.mkPredicate(Object, 'is_rough')
is_kind = solver.mkPredicate(Object, 'is_kind')
```

Now, letâ€™s translate each of the given statements into cvc5 formulas.

1. `'If something eats the bear then it is green.'`:
```python
x = solver.mkVar(Object, 'x')
stmt1 = solver.mkForall(
    [x],
    solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, 
                  solver.mkTerm(eats, x, bear), 
                  solver.mkTerm(is_green, x))
)
solver.assertFormula(stmt1)
```

2. `'All big things are green.'`:
```python
stmt2 = solver.mkForall(
    [x],
    solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, 
                  solver.mkTerm(is_big, x), 
                  solver.mkTerm(is_green, x))
)
solver.assertFormula(stmt2)
```

3. `'If something is red and it likes the dog then the dog is rough.'`:
```python
stmt3 = solver.mkForall(
    [x],
    solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, 
                  solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, 
                                solver.mkTerm(is_red, x), 
                                solver.mkTerm(likes, x, dog)), 
                  solver.mkTerm(is_rough, dog))
)
solver.assertFormula(stmt3)
```

```python
stmt4 = solver.mkForall(
    [x],
    solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, 
                  solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, 
                                solver.mkTerm(is_rough, x), 
                                solver.mkTerm(sees, x, tiger)), 
                  solver.mkTerm(is_big, x))
)
solver.assertFormula(stmt4)
```

```python
stmt5 = solver.mkForall(
    [x],
    solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, 
                  solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, 
                                solver.mkTerm(sees, x, dog), 
                                solver.mkTerm(is_green, dog)), 
                  solver.mkTerm(sees, x, tiger))
)
solver.assertFormula(stmt5)
```

6. `'If something eats the dog and the dog is big then it is kind.'`:
```python
stmt6 = solver.mkForall(
    [x],
    solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES,

                                solver.mkTerm(eats, x, dog), 
                                solver.mkTerm(is_big, dog)),

                                solver.mkTerm(is_kind, x), 
                                solver.mkTerm(is_rough, x)), 
                  solver.mkTerm(eats, x, tiger))
)
solver.assertFormula(stmt7)
```

8. `'If something eats the rabbit and it likes the tiger then it sees the tiger.'`:
```python
stmt8 = solver.mkForall(
    [x],
    solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, 
                  solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, 
                                solver.mkTerm(eats, x, rabbit), 
                                solver.mkTerm(likes, x, tiger)), 
                  solver.mkTerm(sees, x, tiger))
)
solver.assertFormula(stmt8)
```

9. `'If something sees the tiger then the tiger eats the dog.'`:
```python
stmt9 = solver.mkForall(
    [x],
    solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, 
                  solver.mkTerm(sees, x, tiger), 
                  solver.mkTerm(eats, tiger, dog))
)
solver.assertFormula(stmt9)
```

10. `'The bear is big.'`:
```python
stmt10 = solver.mkTerm(is_big, bear)
solver.assertFormula(stmt10)
```

11. `'The bear sees the dog.'`:
```python
stmt11 = solver.mkTerm(sees, bear, dog)
solver.assertFormula(stmt11)
```

12. `'The dog eats the bear.'`:
```python
stmt12 = solver.mkTerm(eats, dog, bear)
solver.assertFormula(stmt12)
```

13. `'The dog eats the rabbit.'`:
```python
stmt13 = solver.mkTerm(eats, dog, rabbit)
solver.assertFormula(stmt13)
```

14. `'The dog is big.'`:
```python
stmt14 = solver.mkTerm(is_big, dog)
solver.assertFormula(stmt14)
```

15. `'The rabbit eats the tiger.'`:
```python

solver.assertFormula(stmt15)
```

solver.assertFormula(stmt16)
```

17. `'The rabbit sees the dog.'`:
```python
stmt17 = solver.mkTerm(sees, rabbit, dog)
solver.assertFormula(stmt17)
```

18. `'The tiger is big.'`:
```python
stmt18 = solver.mkTerm(is_big, tiger)
solver.assertFormula(stmt18)
```

19. `'The tiger is rough.'`:
```python
stmt19 = solver.mkTerm(is_rough, tiger)
solver.assertFormula(stmt19)
```

20. `'The tiger likes the dog.'`:
```python
stmt20 = solver.mkTerm(likes, tiger, dog)
solver.assertFormula(stmt20)
```

### Test Statement: `The rabbit does not see the dog.`
```python
test_stmt = solver.mkTerm(Kind.NOT, solver.mkTerm(sees, rabbit, dog))
```

### Checking Satisfiability
Now, we can check if the test statement is satisfied or not.

```python
solver.push()
solver.assertFormula(test_stmt)

result = solver.checkSat()
print(f"The assertion that 'The rabbit does not see the dog' is: {result}")
```

This code translates the provided natural language statements into a series of SMT formulas using cvc5. The final check will assert whether "The rabbit does not see the dog" is consistent with the given information.
