course_units = Sure, I will extract and format the course units from the given document. Specifically for the "Engineering Fundamentals" section, which includes the direct courses and the electives. The courses listed in that section are:
- CS106B
- ENGR40M or ENGR76
- ENGR108 (mentioned as a math elective and also considered as an elective under Engineering Fundamentals)

Here is the Python list with placeholders for the course units, assuming that units are provided elsewhere:

```python
[
    cs106b_units,
    engr40m_units_or_engr76_units,  # This indicates either ENGR40M or ENGR76 units
    engr108_units
]
```

Since the units were not directly provided in the document for these specific courses, you would need to replace the placeholders (`cs106b_units`, `engr40m_units_or_engr76_units`, and `engr108_units`) with the actual units based on your specific course information.

If we extend it to include courses mentioned as examples, here is another version which includes courses from other sections too:

```python
[
    cs106b_units,
    engr40m_units,
    engr76_units,
    engr108_units,
    math19_units,
    math20_units,
    math21_units,
    cs103_units,
    cs109_units,
    phys41_units,
    phys43_units
]
```

Again, you will need to replace the placeholders with actual course units from your course catalog or records.
