Sure, I'll translate each of the contextual statements and the test statement into CVC5 SMT-LIB formulas using a Python scripting approach. Let's start by defining the necessary variables and then translating each statement:

```python
import cvc5
from cvc5 import Solver, Kind

# Create solver instance
solver = Solver()
solver.setLogic("QF_UF")

# Declare needed sorts
Bool = solver.getBooleanSort()

# Define objects
Anne = solver.mkConst(Bool, "Anne")
Bob = solver.mkConst(Bool, "Bob")
Fiona = solver.mkConst(Bool, "Fiona")
Gary = solver.mkConst(Bool, "Gary")

# Define predicates
nice = solver.mkPredicate(Bool, "nice")
big = solver.mkPredicate(Bool, "big")
kind = solver.mkPredicate(Bool, "kind")
round_ = solver.mkPredicate(Bool, "round")
young = solver.mkPredicate(Bool, "young")
green = solver.mkPredicate(Bool, "green")
white = solver.mkPredicate(Bool, "white")

# Define conditions for the contextual statements
statements = []

# 1. If something is nice and big then it is kind.
x = solver.mkVar(Bool)
statements.append(solver.mkTerm(Kind.FORALL, [x], 
                solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, 
                    solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, nice(x), big(x)), 
                    kind(x))))

# 2. If Anne is round and Anne is young then Anne is green.
statements.append(solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, 
                    solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, round_(Anne), young(Anne)), 
                    green(Anne)))

# 3. Big things are nice.
statements.append(solver.mkTerm(Kind.FORALL, [x], 
                 solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, big(x), nice(x))))

# 4. Kind things are white.
statements.append(solver.mkTerm(Kind.FORALL, [x], 
                 solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, kind(x), white(x))))

# 5. If Anne is kind and Anne is round then Anne is young.
statements.append(solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, 
                    solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, kind(Anne), round_(Anne)), 
                    young(Anne)))

# 6. If something is green and white then it is round.
statements.append(solver.mkTerm(Kind.FORALL, [x], 
                 solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, 
                    solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, green(x), white(x)), 
                    round_(x))))

# 7. All round things are big.
statements.append(solver.mkTerm(Kind.FORALL, [x], 
                 solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, round_(x), big(x))))

# 8. Anne is round.
statements.append(round_(Anne))

# 9. Bob is big.
statements.append(big(Bob))

# 10. Bob is round.
statements.append(round_(Bob))

# 11. Bob is white.
statements.append(white(Bob))

# 12. Fiona is big.
statements.append(big(Fiona))

# 13. Fiona is green.
statements.append(green(Fiona))

# 14. Fiona is kind.
statements.append(kind(Fiona))

# 15. Fiona is round.
statements.append(round_(Fiona))

# 16. Fiona is young.
statements.append(young(Fiona))

# 17. Gary is nice.
statements.append(nice(Gary))

# 18. Gary is round.
statements.append(round_(Gary))

# Assert all statements to the solver
for statement in statements:
    solver.assertFormula(statement)

# Test Statement: Anne is green.
test_statement = green(Anne)

solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(Kind.NOT, test_statement))  # We assert the negation to check for satisfiability

# Check satisfiability
result = solver.checkSat()

# Output the result
if result.isSat():
    print("The test statement is UNSATISFIED.")
else:
    print("The test statement is SATISFIED.")

# Since we want to ensure that our translation is correct, we will expect the solver to show the condition.
if result.isSat():
    print("Anne is NOT green as per the given statements.")
else:
    print("Anne is green as per the given statements.")
```

This script translates the natural language statements into SMT-LIB format using the CVC5 Python API. It contains parameter declarations, assertions, and a test case for the statement "Anne is green.". Running this script with CVC5 Python bindings will evaluate the satisfiability of the test statement. If the solver returns UNSAT, it indicates the test statement is correct based on the given contextual logic; otherwise, it is incorrect.
