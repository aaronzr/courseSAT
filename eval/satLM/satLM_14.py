Here's how you can construct the constraints in Z3Py for the provided problem:

```python
from z3 import *

# Interns
interns = ['Farber', 'Gombarick', 'Hall', 'Jackson', 'Kanze', 'Lha']

# Stories
stories = ['Romania', 'Spain', 'Tuscany']

# Roles
roles = ['Photographer', 'Writer']

# Variables
assigned_story = {intern: Int(intern + '_story') for intern in interns}
assigned_role = {intern: Int(intern + '_role') for intern in interns}

# Create solver
s = Solver()

# Each intern is trained either as a photographer's assistant or as a writer's assistant
for role in assigned_role.values():
    s.add(Or(role == 0, role == 1))

# Each story is assigned a team of two internsâ€”one photographer's assistant and one writer's assistant
for story in range(len(stories)):
    s.add(Sum([If(assigned_story[intern] == story, 1, 0) for intern in interns]) == 2)
    s.add(Sum([If(And(assigned_story[intern] == story, assigned_role[intern] == 0), 1, 0) for intern in interns]) == 1)
    s.add(Sum([If(And(assigned_story[intern] == story, assigned_role[intern] == 1), 1, 0) for intern in interns]) == 1)

# Constraints
s.add(assigned_role['Gombarick'] == assigned_role['Lha'])  # Gombarick and Lha will be trained in the same field
s.add(assigned_role['Farber'] != assigned_role['Kanze'])   # Farber and Kanze will be trained in different fields
s.add(assigned_role['Hall'] == 0)                          # Hall will be trained as a photographer's assistant
s.add(assigned_story['Jackson'] == 2)                      # Jackson is assigned to Tuscany
s.add(assigned_story['Kanze'] != 1)                        # Kanze is not assigned to Spain

# Question: Which one of the following interns CANNOT be assigned to Tuscany?
options = {
    'A': 'Farber',
    'B': 'Gombarick',
    'C': 'Hall',
    'D': 'Kanze',
    'E': 'Lha'
}

# Check each option
for option, intern in options.items():
    test_solver = s.translate()
    test_solver.add(assigned_story[intern] == 2)
    if test_solver.check() == unsat:
        print(f"The intern that cannot be assigned to Tuscany is: {option}) {intern}")
        break
```

In this script:

1. The `assigned_story` dictionary maps each intern to an integer representing one of the three stories.
2. The `assigned_role` dictionary maps each intern to an integer representing either the photographer's assistant (0) or the writer's assistant (1).
3. Constraints ensure that each story team consists of exactly one photographer's assistant and one writer's assistant.
4. Specific conditions from the problem are added as constraints to the solver. 
5. The options are iteratively checked by adding a constraint that the intern is assigned to Tuscany and seeing if the solver can still find a solution. If it can't (unsat), we print out that this intern cannot be assigned to Tuscany.

Running this code will give you the intern who cannot be assigned to Tuscany according to the given constraints.
