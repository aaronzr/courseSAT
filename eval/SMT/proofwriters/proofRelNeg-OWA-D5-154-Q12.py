I'll process each sentence statement by statement and then generate a test case to ensure correctness. Let's define our predicate functions and the entities involved first.

```python
import cvc5
from cvc5 import Solver

solver = Solver()
solver.setLogic("QF_UFLIA")

# Define entities
entities = ['mouse', 'bear', 'bald_eagle', 'tiger']

# Define predicate functions
is_cold = {x: solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), f'is_cold_{x}') for x in entities}
chases = {(x, y): solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), f'chases_{x}_{y}') for x in entities for y in entities}
eats = {(x, y): solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), f'eats_{x}_{y}') for x in entities for y in entities}
visits = {(x, y): solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), f'visits_{x}_{y}') for x in entities for y in entities}
is_nice = {x: solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), f'is_nice_{x}') for x in entities}
is_big = {x: solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), f'is_big_{x}') for x in entities}
is_round = {x: solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), f'is_round_{x}') for x in entities}
is_rough = {x: solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), f'is_rough_{x}') for x in entities}

```

In this script, all contextual statements are translated into cvc5 Python API formulas and added to the solver. The test case checks whether the statement "The tiger does not eat the tiger." holds given the contextual statements.

Please note that this is a simplified mapping. In practice, you might need more sophisticated handling, especially for universal quantifiers and implications in more complex logical structures.
