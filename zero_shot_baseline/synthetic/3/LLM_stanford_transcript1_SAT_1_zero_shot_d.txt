- **Units Requirement**: Satisfied (135 units total).
- **Senior Project Requirement**: Implicitly satisfied based on degree conferral.

### Conclusion:
Except verifying **Technology in Society** course, the rest of the requirements have been met.

Given the possible implicit completion reflected in the degree award, if confirmed, the transcript satisfies all the BS degree requirements for the Computer Science program at Stanford.

### Final Output:
"BS SAT"

**Note:** If there is no record of the Technology in Society course or explicit senior project course confirmed, those points need the checked for possible missing listings/records.========================GPT Answer to Prompt Two Regarding MS Requirements====================
Based on the provided transcript of Emily Jane Smith, let's analyze the courses to determine if all Master in Science (MS) requirements for the Artificial Intelligence Specialization are met.

### Foundations Requirement
Courses required for the Foundations requirement include:
1. Logic, Automata & Complexity (CS103) - Completed (A-)
2. Probability (CS109) - Completed (B+)
3. Algorithmic Analysis (CS161) - Completed (A-)
4. Computer Organ & Systems (CS107) - Completed (A)
5. Principles of Computer Systems (CS110/111) - Completed (CS111, A-)

Hence, all Foundation requirements are satisfied.

### Significant Implementation Requirement
Emily must take one of the specified courses for this requirement, from CS 140, 140E, 143, 144, 145, 148, 151, 190, 210B, 212, 221, 227B, 231N, 243, 248/248A, and 341. Since CS 227B (A) is completed in Spring, it satisfies this requirement.

### Breadth Requirement
Emily needs to complete courses from three different breadth areas. These courses must be taken for a letter grade and should be at least 3 units each.

1. **Area A (Mathematical and Theoretical Foundations)**
   - CS 154, 157, 168, 254, 261, 265; EE 364A, 364B; Phil 251
   - PHIL 151 (Metalogic) seems closely related to foundations but is not listed as an option directly. Since no other course applicable to Area A is listed, this requirement remains unmet.

2. **Area B (Computer Systems)**
   - CS 140, 140E, 143, 144, 149, 212, 242, 243, 244, 244B, 295, 316, 358; EE 180, 282, 382E
   - Completed CS 111 (A-)

3. **Area C (Applications)**
   - CS 145, 147, 148, 155, 173, 221, 223A, 224N, 224U, 224W, 227B, 228, 229, 229M, 231A, 231N, 234, 236, 237A, 245, 246, 247 (any suffix), 248/248A, 251, 255, 273A, 273B, 279, 345, 347, 348A, 348B, 348C, 348E, 348I, 348K, 355, 356, 373
   - Completed CS 224N (A)

4. **Area D (Computing and Society)**
   - Includes courses like CS 152, 181, 182, 256, 281, 329T, 384; AMSTUD 133, 145; etc.
   - No relevant course listed. Lacking required DS/CS elective.

Given that the breadth requirement must cover three areas and Emily does not have a confirmed course in Area A or D, the Breadth Requirement is unmet.

### Depth Requirement
Emily needs to fulfill 21 units from specified AI-related courses, split across three parts:
1. CS 221 - Completed (B+)
2. At least four from specified list - Completed CS 224N (A), CS 224S (A), CS 227B (A), CS 238 (A-)
3. Courses from a to c including additional options to make 21 units.

Summing units:
- CS 221: 5 units
- CS 224N, CS 224S: (3 + 4 = 7 units)
- CS 227B, CS 238: (3 + 3 = 6 units)
Total: 18 units for Depth. Missing 3 units.

### Electives Requirement
Emily must complete additional courses for the total units to be 45:
1. CS 229, CS 230, EE 123 (All relevant, totalling units)

Unit breakdown:
- Undergraduate courses apply only if not counted undergrad.
- Since all foundations are covered, additional electives included as without units:
  3 (from unclear electives)

Emily's coursework does not seem to confirm the completion of the Breadth Requirement nor 21 Depth units.

### Conclusion
Based on the above points, Emily Jane Smith is still lacking specific units or courses:
- One confirmed course from Breadth Area A or D.
- 3 units extra for Depth.

Output:
```plaintext
Missing Breadth Requirement for Areas A or D
3 more units required for AI Depth
```
