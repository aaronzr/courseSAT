To determine whether the student's transcript satisfies the BS and MS requirements for the programs provided, I must compare the courses and credits earned by the student against the required courses and credits outlined in the degree programs.

Given the extensive details of both the BS and MS requirements, let’s break down the analysis in steps:

### Step 1: Retrieve and Parse the Student's Transcript
First, I would open the provided transcript file:
```python
with open('/home/sallyjunsongwang/courseSAT/transcripts/synthetic/LLM_stanford_transcript1_SAT_8.txt', 'r') as file:
    transcript = file.read()
```

Here’s what we would do next:

### Step 2: Extract the Courses and Grades from the Transcript
I would extract the relevant course information – course title, grade, and units – for both the BS and MS requirements.

### Step 3: Compare BS Core and Senior Project Requirements
Using the requirements provided, we will check each category for the BS program to see if the student has completed the required courses with the specified units and grades.

### Step 4: Check the Electives and Additional Course Requirements for the BS Program
We need to ensure the student has taken sufficient electives and other listed requirements.

### Step 5: Compare MS Specialization Requirements
Once the BS requirements are satisfied, we then perform a similar check against the MS specialization requirements, including the foundations, breadth, depth, and electives.

### Key Points for Comparison:
1. **BS Core Requirements**: Verify if the student has taken all mandatory core courses (CS 103, 107, 109, 111, 161), each with a minimum of 5 units.
2. **BS Senior Project**: Ensure the student has completed one of the senior project courses with enough units.
3. **BS AI Elective Requirements**: Check if the specific number of units in foundational Math and Science, Technology in Society, Engineering Fundamentals, and required track courses have been completed.
4. **MS Specialization Requirements**: Verify fulfillment of foundation and significant implementation courses, breadth area courses from different areas, depth courses, and electives totaling at least 45 units.

### Output Decisions:
- If the BS requirements are not fully satisfied, output the specific courses that are missing.
- If BS requirements are satisfied but MS requirements are not, output the missing MS courses.
- If all requirements for both programs are satisfied, output "BS SAT" and "MS SAT".

### Sample Approach in Python:
Below is an illustrative script showing the approach to comparing BS requirements:
```python
# Sample pseudocode for parsing the transcript and validating against requirements

def parse_transcript(transcript_text):
    # This function would parse the transcript and extract relevant course information
    # For the sake of this example, we will assume the data is already parsed into a dictionary or list
    ... # Implementation depends on the transcript format
    return parsed_courses

def check_bs_requirements(parsed_courses):
    # Define required courses for BS
    bs_requirements = {
        'core': {'CS103': 5, 'CS107': 5, 'CS109': 5, 'CS111': 5, 'CS161': 5},
        'senior_project': ['CS194', 'CS194W', 'CS210B', 'CS191', 'CS191W'],
        # Add elective and additional requirements similarly
    }
    missing_courses = []
    
    # Check core courses
    for course, units in bs_requirements['core'].items():
        if not any(c for c in parsed_courses if c['course'] == course and c['units'] >= units and c['grade'] >= 'C'):
            missing_courses.append(course)
    
    # Check senior project
    if not any(c for c in parsed_courses if c['course'] in bs_requirements['senior_project'] and c['units'] >= 3 and c['grade'] >= 'C'):
        missing_courses.append('Senior Project')
    
    # Perform similar checks for other BS requirements
    
    return missing_courses

def check_ms_requirements(parsed_courses):
    # Define required courses for MS
    ms_requirements = {
        'foundations': {...},
        'breadth': {...},
        'depth': {...},
        'electives': {...},
    }
    missing_courses = []
    
    # Check each MS requirement similarly to BS
    # For brevity, we'll assume similar structure and checks
    ...
    
    return missing_courses

# Main process
parsed_courses = parse_transcript(transcript)
bs_missing_courses = check_bs_requirements(parsed_courses)

if not bs_missing_courses:
    print("BS SAT")
    ms_missing_courses = check_ms_requirements(parsed_courses)
    if not ms_missing_courses:
        print("MS SAT")
    else:
        print("Missing MS courses:", ms_missing_courses)
else:
    print("Missing BS courses:", bs_missing_courses)
```

This script provides a template for parsing the student’s transcript and checking it against the degree requirements. The detailed course-specific checks would need to be implemented, and the transcript format needs to be parsed appropriately.
