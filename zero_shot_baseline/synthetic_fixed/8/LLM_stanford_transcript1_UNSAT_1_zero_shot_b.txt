  - Not explicitly mentioned.

#### Breadth Requirement:
- Various course choices; need 3 from different areas.
  - Not enough details in depth.

#### AI Depth:
- **CS 221**:
  - Not covered, needs to check.
- **Four depth courses**:
  - CS 303, CS 306, CS 307, CS 402, CS 403: Covered.
  
#### Electives:
- Enough information not provided.

**Courses not explicitly covered or missing for MS**:
