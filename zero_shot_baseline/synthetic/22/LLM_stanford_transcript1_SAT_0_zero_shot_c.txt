### MS Specialization Requirements Analysis:

#### Foundations Requirement:
- **CS 103 Logic, Automata & Complexity**: Completed during BS (though specifics aren't reiterated).
- **CS 109 Probability**: Completed during BS.
- **CS 161 Algorithmic Analysis**: Completed during BS.
- **CS 107 Computer Org & Sys**: Completed during BS.
- **CS 111 Principles of Computer Systems**: Completed during BS.
Total Units Used to Satisfy Foundations: Already met during BS. The specific units from the BS cannot be reused for MS requirements.

#### Significant Implementation Requirement:
- **CS 243 Systems and Networks Security**: Completed with A (which is a suitable course for the requirement).

#### Breadth Requirement:
The student needs three courses from different Areas A-D. Each course can only satisfy one requirement.

- **Area A**: (None listed in transcript)
- **Area B**: **CS 242 Programming Languages**: Completed with A-
- **Area C**: **CS 224N Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning**: Completed with A
- **Area D**: **ANTHRO 132D Technology and Society**: Completed with A- and satisfies the Technology in Society requirement for BS.

#### Artificial Intelligence Depth Requirements:
- **CS 221 AI: Principles and Techniques**: Completed
- Four of the following:
  - **CS 223A**: Completed with B+
  - **CS 224N**: Completed with A
  - **CS 234**: Completed with B+
  - **CS 239**: Completed with B+
- Additional Depth Courses to total at least 21 units:
  - **CS 230 Deep Learning for Computer Vision**: Completed with A-
  - **CS 276 Information Retrieval and Web Search**: Completed with B+
  - **CS 327A Advanced Robotics**: Completed with A-

Total Depth Units for MSCS: More than 21 units are accumulated from the above-depth requirement courses. 

#### Electives:
Students need additional courses to complete the 45-unit requirement.

- **PHIL 151 Philosophy of Science**: 3 units (A)
- **PSYCH 209 Cognitive Science**: 4 units (A)
- The rest of the elective units can be gathered from the surplus courses mentioned above.

#### GPA Compliance:
The average grade in courses submitted must be at least a B (3.0 on Stanfordâ€™s GPA scale). Given above grades, the student exceeds this requirement.

### Conclusion for MS Requirements:
**MS SAT**
