### Requirements and Constraints for Rule 2090. Know Your Customer (KYC) from FINRA:

#### Requirements:
1. **Reasonable Diligence in Account Handling:**
   - Every member must exercise reasonable diligence concerning the opening and maintenance of every account.
   - Essential facts regarding every customer must be known and retained.

2. **Criteria for "Essential Facts":**
   - Essential facts are those required to:
     a. Effectively service the customer's account.
     b. Act in accordance with any special handling instructions for the account.
     c. Understand the authority of each person acting on behalf of the customer.
     d. Comply with applicable laws, regulations, and rules.

#### Constraints:
1. **Supplementary Material .01:**
   - Provides detailed criteria for what constitutes "essential facts."

2. **Effective Dates and Notices:**
   - Rule adopted by SR-FINRA-2010-039 and amended by SR-FINRA-2011-016, effective July 9, 2012.
   - Relevant regulatory notices include: 
     - Regulatory Notice 11-02: SEC approval of the consolidated FINRA rules for KYC and suitability obligations (January 10, 2011).
     - Regulatory Notice 11-25: New implementation date and additional guidance (May 18, 2011).
     - Regulatory Notice 12-25: Additional guidance on the new suitability rule (May 18, 2012).

### Summary:
The "Know Your Customer" rule specifies that every financial firm must use reasonable diligence to understand the essential facts about their customers to provide effective service, follow account handling instructions, recognize the authority of those acting on the customer's behalf, and comply with laws and regulations. These requirements have been defined and revised through several notices and amendments.===================generated formulas===========================
To convert the requirements and constraints of FINRA Rule 2090 ("Know Your Customer") into cvc5 SMT formulas, we need to formalize each of the identified points. Here's a structured approach to do that:

### Declarations
First, we'll declare necessary variables:
- `Customer` represents a customer.
- `Account` represents an account.

We'll use predicates and functions to represent the relationships:
- `owns(Customer, Account)`: Customer owns an account.
- `effective_service(Customer)`: Service provided to the customer's account is effective.
- `special_handling(Account)`: There are special handling instructions for the account.
- `authority_of(Person, Customer)`: Person has authority to act on behalf of the customer.
- `compliance_with_law(Customer)`: Customer's account complies with applicable laws, regulations, and rules.

### SMT-LIB Translation
Now, we translate the requirements and constraints into cvc5 SMT-LIB format.

```smt
(set-logic ALL)

; Declare sorts for Customers and Accounts
(declare-sort Customer 0)
(declare-sort Account 0)
(declare-sort Person 0)

; Predicates
(declare-fun owns (Customer Account) Bool)
(declare-fun effective_service (Customer) Bool)
(declare-fun special_handling (Account) Bool)
(declare-fun authority_of (Person Customer) Bool)
(declare-fun compliance_with_law (Customer) Bool)

; Requirements and Constraints

; 1. Reasonable Diligence in Account Handling
; Every member must exercise reasonable diligence concerning the opening and maintenance of every account.
; Essential facts regarding every customer must be known and retained.

; Rule 1: Every account must belong to a customer with essential facts known
(assert (forall ((c Customer) (a Account))
  (=> (owns(c, a))
      (and (effective_service(c))
           (compliance_with_law(c))
           (exists ((p Person)) (authority_of(p, c)))))))

; 2. Criteria for "Essential Facts":
; Essential facts are those required to:
; a. Effectively service the customer's account.
(assert (forall ((c Customer))
  (=> (effective_service(c)) true)))

; b. Act in accordance with any special handling instructions for the account.
(assert (forall ((a Account))
  (=> (special_handling(a)) true)))

; c. Understand the authority of each person acting on behalf of the customer.
(assert (forall ((c Customer) (p Person))
  (=> (authority_of(p, c)) true)))

; d. Comply with applicable laws, regulations, and rules.
(assert (forall ((c Customer))
  (=> (compliance_with_law(c)) true)))

; Effectivity dates and notices (for additional rigor, but can't be directly translated into SMT constraints)
; These constraints provide context for when such rules and notices need to be adhered to but do not map directly
; to computational constraints/forms.

### Explanation
1. **Declarations**: We declare sorts for `Customer`, `Account`, and `Person`.
2. **Predicates**: We declare predicates to represent the essential facts and relationships.
   - `owns`: To establish ownership between a customer and an account.
   - `effective_service`: To assert that we effectively service a customer's account.
   - `special_handling`: Indicates if there are special handling instructions for an account.
   - `authority_of`: Shows who has authority to act on behalf of a customer.
   - `compliance_with_law`: To assert compliance with laws, regulations, and rules.
3. **Constraints**:
   - `Rule 1` ensures that for every account owned, essential facts about the customer must be known, retaining effective service, compliance, and understanding authority.
   - Rules `a` to `d` define the criteria of essential facts to ensure effective service, special handling instructions, authority understanding, and compliance with laws.

Finally, we use `check-sat` to pose a satisfiability query to the solver.

This SMT encoding represents the constraints required for Rule 2090 in a logical formal language that could be checked by the cvc5 SMT solver.
