**Bachelors of Science (BS) Requirements Analysis:**

**Core Requirements Analysis:**

1. **Systems (CS Core):**
   - **CS 106B: Programming Abstractions**
   - **CS 107: Computer Organization and Systems** - **Not completed**
   - **CS 111: Operating Systems Principles** - **Completed (CS 200)**

2. **Theory (CS Core):**
   - **CS 103: Mathematical Foundations of Computing** - **Not completed**
   - **CS 109: Introduction to Probability for Computer Scientists** - **Completed**
   - **CS 161: Design and Analysis of Algorithms** - **Completed (CS 250)**

3. **Senior Project:**
   - One course required **(CS 199 AI Capstone Project)** - **Completed**

**AI Track Requirements Analysis:**

1. **Mathematics:**
   - MATH 19, 20, 21 - **Not explicitly listed on the transcript**
   - Additional electives are not verified from listed acceptable courses, **Math elective requirement is partially met**.

2. **Science Requirements:**
   - PHYS series (Mechanics, Electricity and Magnetism) - **Not explicitly listed on the transcript**
   - One Science elective - **Partially completed**

3. **Technology in Society Requirement:**
   - One course from approved list - **Not explicitly listed on the transcript**

4. **Engineering Fundamentals:**
   - **CS 106B** - Completed
   - **ENGR 40M or 76** - **Not explicitly listed**

5. **Depth Requirements:**
   - **CS 221: AI Principles and Techniques** - **Completed (CS 210)**
   - Track Requirement B from 2 different areas - **CS 260**
   - One additional course from Track Requirement C list (may substitute with approved track electives) - **CS 260, and BIO 110**, additional electives are also verified.
   - Three additional courses from Depth Elective List - **Multiple courses completed**

**Overall Analysis for BS Requirements:**
- **Several core requirements and AI track specifics such as Math 19-21, Physics series (PHYS 41, PHYS 43), Technology in Society, and ENGR courses** are not explicitly listed on the transcript.
- **Courses such as CS 107 (Computer Organization and Systems) and CS 103 (Mathematical Foundations of Computing)** have not been fulfilled.

**Output: "BS Not Satisfied".**

List of courses not satisfied:
- **CS 107 (Computer Organization and Systems)**
- **CS 103 (Mathematical Foundations of Computing)**
- **Math 19-21 (or verified equivalents)**
- **Physics series PHYS 41 & PHYS 43 (or verified equivalents)**
- **Technology in Society Course**
- **ENGR 40M or 76**

**Master of Science (MS) Requirements Analysis:**

**Foundations Requirement:**
- **CS103** or equivalent not explicitly listed.
- **CS109** - Completed (under BS requirements).
- **CS161** - Completed (under BS requirements).
- **CS107 or 107E** - Not completed.
- **CS111** - Completed (CS 200).

**Significant Implementation Requirement:**
- **Could be satisfied by CS 199 (AI Capstone Project)**.

**Breadth Requirement:**
- Chosen from different areas: 3 courses listed as fulfilled partially in transcript.
  - **One from Area A:** **CS 250** (Advanced Algorithms).
  - **One from Area B:** No courses directly listed.
  - **One from Area C:** **CS 210 and CS 260**

**Depth Requirements:**
- **CS 221: AI Principles and Techniques** - Completed (CS 210).
- At least 4 courses from specified list - **CS 223A, CS 224N, CS 224S, CS 224U, CS 224V,** not explicitly listed.
- Total at least 21 units from categories a, b, or c: total units not explicitly calculated.

**Electives:**
- **Transcript lists a few electives related but not complete verification**.

**Overall Analysis for MS Requirements:**
- **Missing course listings for full breadth, foundations, and elective verification**.
- **CS 107 and some required AI electives are not explicitly completed.**

**Output: "MS Not Satisfied".**

List of courses not satisfied:
- **Foundations: CS103 (Mathematical Foundations of Computing), CS107 (Computer Organization and Systems)**
- **Breadth: Need one more course for full breadth coverage**
- **AI Depth: Additional at least 1 course from specified AI electives list.**
