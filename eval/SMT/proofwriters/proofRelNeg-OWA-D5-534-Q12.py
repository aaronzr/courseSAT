We'll use a higher order logic representation for the statements.

First, we'll import the necessary library and initialize the solver:

```python
import cvc5
from cvc5 import Solver, Kind

solver = Solver()
solver.setOption("produce-models", "true")
solver.setLogic("QF_UF")
```

Next, let's declare the functions and predicates that will be useful for our statements:

```python
# Declaring sorts (types)
Person = solver.mkUninterpretedSort("Person")
Animal = solver.mkUninterpretedSort("Animal")

# Declaring predicates
Needs = solver.mkFun(solver.mkFunctionSort([Person, Animal], solver.getBooleanSort()), "Needs")
Likes = solver.mkFun(solver.mkFunctionSort([Person, Animal], solver.getBooleanSort()), "Likes")
Sees = solver.mkFun(solver.mkFunctionSort([Person, Animal], solver.getBooleanSort()), "Sees")
Kind = solver.mkFun(solver.mkFunctionSort([Person], solver.getBooleanSort()), "Kind")
Nice = solver.mkFun(solver.mkFunctionSort([Animal], solver.getBooleanSort()), "Nice")
Red = solver.mkFun(solver.mkFunctionSort([Person], solver.getBooleanSort()), "Red")

# Declaring constants for animals
cow = solver.mkConst(Animal, "cow")
mouse = solver.mkConst(Animal, "mouse")
rabbit = solver.mkConst(Animal, "rabbit")
squirrel = solver.mkConst(Animal, "squirrel")
```

Now, let's translate each of the contextual statements:

```python
# 1. If someone needs the mouse and they need the rabbit then the rabbit needs the cow.
x = solver.mkVar(Person, "x")
statement1 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES,
                           solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND,
                                         solver.mkTerm(Needs, x, mouse),
                                         solver.mkTerm(Needs, x, rabbit)),
                           solver.mkTerm(Needs, rabbit, cow))

solver.assertFormula(statement1)

# 2. If someone sees the rabbit then the rabbit needs the mouse.
statement2 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES,
                           solver.mkTerm(Sees, x, rabbit),
                           solver.mkTerm(Needs, rabbit, mouse))

solver.assertFormula(statement2)

# 3. If someone needs the cow then they like the squirrel.
statement3 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES,
                           solver.mkTerm(Needs, x, cow),
                           solver.mkTerm(Likes, x, squirrel))

solver.assertFormula(statement3)

# 4. If someone sees the squirrel then they see the rabbit.
statement4 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES,
                           solver.mkTerm(Sees, x, squirrel),
                           solver.mkTerm(Sees, x, rabbit))

solver.assertFormula(statement4)

# 5. If someone is kind and they see the squirrel then they need the mouse.
statement5 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES,
                           solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, Kind(solver.mkTerm(Kind, Kind(x)),
                                                        solver.mkTerm(Sees, x, squirrel)),
                           solver.mkTerm(Needs, x, mouse))

solver.assertFormula(statement5)

# 6. If someone likes the squirrel and the squirrel sees the cow then they are red.
statement6 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES,
                           solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND,
                                         solver.mkTerm(Likes, x, squirrel),
                                         solver.mkTerm(Sees, squirrel, cow)),
                           solver.mkTerm(Red, x))

solver.assertFormula(statement6)

# 7. If someone needs the mouse then they see the squirrel.
statement7 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES,
                           solver.mkTerm(Needs, x, mouse),
                           solver.mkTerm(Sees, x, squirrel))

solver.assertFormula(statement7)

# 8. The cow likes the rabbit.
statement8 = solver.mkTerm(Likes, cow, rabbit)
solver.assertFormula(statement8)

# 9. The cow needs the mouse.
statement9 = solver.mkTerm(Needs, cow, mouse)
solver.assertFormula(statement9)

# 10. The mouse likes the squirrel.
statement10 = solver.mkTerm(Likes, mouse, squirrel)
solver.assertFormula(statement10)

# 11. The rabbit needs the cow.
statement11 = solver.mkTerm(Needs, rabbit, cow)
solver.assertFormula(statement11)

# 12. The rabbit sees the cow.
statement12 = solver.mkTerm(Sees, rabbit, cow)
solver.assertFormula(statement12)

# 13. The squirrel is nice.
statement13 = solver.mkTerm(Nice, squirrel)
solver.assertFormula(statement13)

# 14. The squirrel needs the cow.
statement14 = solver.mkTerm(Needs, squirrel, cow)
solver.assertFormula(statement14)
```

Finally, let's translate the test statement ("The rabbit does not see the rabbit") and check its satisfaction:

```python
test_statement = solver.mkTerm(Kind.NOT, solver.mkTerm(Sees, rabbit, rabbit))

solver.assertFormula(test_statement)

# Let's check if the test statement is satisfied
result = solver.checkSat()
print("Test Statement is: ", result)
```

Running this code, you should be able to see whether the test statement "The rabbit does not see the rabbit" is satisfied given the context. This will help ensure the logic and syntax are correct.
