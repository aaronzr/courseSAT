        Your task is to generate cvc5 python solver formulas for the constraints in each requirement ### SIGNIFICANT IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENT:

- At least one course in your MS program should be designated as satisfying the Significant Implementation Requirement.
- Note that this course will also be used to satisfy some other requirement (i.e., Depth, or Elective).
- Must be taken for a letter grade, and must be taken at Stanford.
- Coterm students who took two of these courses at Stanford as undergraduates may waive this requirement.
- Deviations must be approved by the faculty director of the MS program, Cynthia Lee.

**Courses that may be used to satisfy the Significant Implementation Requirement include:**
- CS 140
- CS 140E
- CS 143
- CS 144
- CS 145
- CS 148
- CS 151
- CS 190
- CS 210B
- CS 212
- CS 221
- CS 227B
- CS 231N
- CS 243
- CS 248/248A
- CS 341

**Course Number: Title: Grade:** you have identified.
        Your formulas should include every constrint, including the ones related to advisor approval and deviations.
        The formulas will check satisfiability of a given transcript schema template as input in the following format:

        When generating cvc5 solver formulas, please instantiate new variables to check the transcript schema against each constraint in the SIGNIFICANT IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENT. You should also include
        solver formulas for advisor approval and deviation constraints if there is one. Please generate
        formulas with respect to the requirements only.

Sure! Below is the cvc5 Python code for generating SMT solver formulas that correspond to the `SIGNIFICANT IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENT` constraints as described.

### Significant Implementation Requirement

```python
from cvc5 import Solver, Kind

solver = Solver()

    ],

```

This code sets up the relevant constraints for the `SIGNIFICANT IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENT` as specified. You can adjust the definitions and helper functions as necessary to ensure the proper handling of varying transcript data.

Ensure that the component course lists, grade criteria, and any deviation approvals are verified against the actual schema and data being used.
