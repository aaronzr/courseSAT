Sure! Let's extract the required courses from the "Engineering Fundamentals" section, including any relevant elective courses mentioned in the notes.

The courses directly mentioned in the Engineering Fundamentals section are:
1. CS106B
2. ENGR40M
3. ENGR76

Additionally, according to note (2) under the "Mathematics and Science Requirements," electives include courses such as ENGR 108.

Combining the required courses and the electives:

```python
courses = ["CS106B", "ENGR40M", "ENGR76", "ENGR108"]
```

Here is the single Python list containing the course numbers:

```python
["CS106B", "ENGR40M", "ENGR76", "ENGR108"]
```
