==========================================Based on Jane Doe's transcript and given the requirements for the BS in Computer Science, the following analysis applies:

### BS Core Requirements:
1. **Programming Abstractions (CS106B)** - Completed with a grade of C+
2. **Computer Organization and Systems (CS107)** - Completed with a grade of B
3. **Principles of Computer Systems (CS111)** - Completed with a grade of C
4. **Mathematical Foundations of Computing (CS103)** - Not listed in the transcript.
5. **Introduction to Probability for Computer Scientists (CS109)** - Completed with a grade of C
6. **Design and Analysis of Algorithms (CS161)** - Completed with a grade of C

### Senior Project Requirements:
Jane completed **CS210B** (Software Engineering), which can fulfill the senior project requirement. Completed with a grade of B+.

### AI Track Core, Depth, and Elective Requirements:
#### Core:
1. **CS107** - Completed with a grade of B
2. **CS111** - Completed with a grade of C
3. **CS161** - Completed with a grade of C

#### Depth (Track Requirements):
1. **CS221** - Not listed in the transcript.
2. **Two courses from different areas (Track Requirement B)**:
    - **CS124 (Natural Language Processing)** - Completed with a grade of C+
    - **CS231A (Computer Vision)** - Completed with a grade of C+
3. **One additional course from the Track Requirement B list or Other:** 
    - **CS225A (Robotics)** - Completed with a grade of B+
4. **Three additional electives:**
     - **CS271 (Artificial Intelligence)** - Completed with a grade of C
     - **CS234 (Reinforcement Learning)** - Completed with a grade of C-
     - **CS348 (Large-Scale Learning)** - Completed with a grade of B

### GPA Requirements:
- Minimum GPA of 2.0 for ENGR Fundamentals, Core, Depth, and Senior Project courses.
- Accumulated GPA: 2.901

### Conclusion on BS Requirements:
1. **Satisfactory Courses List:**
    - CS103 (Mathematical Foundations of Computing) not found in transcript
    - CS221 (AI: Principles and Techniques) not found in transcript

If Jane Doe had taken CS103 and CS221, then all BS requirements would be satisfied except for these two courses. Because of this:

**BS SAT** cannot be output. Instead, the output must be:
- Missing CS103 (Mathematical Foundations of Computing)
- Missing CS221 (AI: Principles and Techniques)

## MS Specialization (Given If BS requirements were met first):

### Foundations Requirement:
1. **CS103 (Logic, Automata & Complexity)** - Not completed in the transcript.
2. **CS109 (Probability)** - Completed with a grade of C
3. **CS161 (Algorithmic Analysis)** - Completed with a grade of C
4. **CS107 (Computer Organization & Systems)** - Completed with a grade of B
5. **CS111 (Principles of Computer Systems)** - Completed with a grade of C

### Significant Implementation Requirement:
- CS210B fulfilled this requirement, completed with a grade of B+

### Breadth Requirement:
1. **Area A: Mathematical and Theoretical Foundations** - Not listed in the transcript.
2. **Area B: Computer Systems** - CS140 completed with a grade of B+
3. **Area C: Applications** - CS348K completed with a grade of B
4. **Area D: Computing and Society** - Not listed in the transcript.

### Artificial Intelligence Depth:
1. **CS221** - Not listed in the transcript
2. **Four additional from the list**:
    - CS231A (Computer Vision) - Completed with C+
    - CS234 (Reinforcement Learning) - Completed with C-
    - CS271 (Artificial Intelligence) - Completed with C
    - CS348 (Large-Scale Learning) - Completed with B
    
### Electives:
- No specific additional electives listed. 

### Conclusion on MS Requirements:
Given the MS specialization requirements and considering the issues faced with the BS requirements and depending on the course equivalents, Jane has yet to meet the following MS requirements:

1. Missing CS103 for Foundations.
2. Breadth Requirement missing an Area A and Area D course.
3. Depth Requirement missing CS221.

Thus, **MS SAT** cannot be output. Instead, the output must be: 
1. **Missing Area A Breadth Course**
2. **Missing Area D Breadth Course**
3. **Missing CS103 (Foundations)**
4. **Missing CS221 (Depth)**

Overall, the output for BS and MS specializations would be as follows:

### Output:

- **BS Requirements Not Satisfied**:
   - Missing CS103 (Mathematical Foundations of Computing)
   - Missing CS221 (AI: Principles and Techniques)
- **MS Requirements Not Satisfied**:
   - Missing CS103 for Foundations.
   - Missing **Area A** Breadth Course
   - Missing **Area D** Breadth Course
   - Missing CS221
