### Conclusion
#### BS Requirements:
Not satisfied. The following courses are not accounted for:
1. MATH 19, 20, 21 (AP credit may cover MATH 19, 20, 21)
2. CS 103: Mathematical Foundations of Computing
3. CS 109: Introduction to Probability for Computer Scientists

10. Senior Project not explicitly listed

#### MS Requirements:
Not satisfied. The following courses are not accounted for:
1. Foundation requirements (CS 103, CS 109, CS 161, CS 107, CS 111)
2. Significant Implementation Requirement course
3. Breadth Requirement (three courses from different areas)
4. AI Depth courses
5. Electives to complete the 45-unit requirement

### Output

**BS Requirements:**
```
Courses not satisfied:
1. CS 103: Mathematical Foundations of Computing
2. CS 109: Introduction to Probability for Computer Scientists
3. PHYS 43: Electricity and Magnetism
4. ENGR 40M or 76
5. CS 107: Computer Organization and Systems
6. CS 111: Operating Systems Principles
7. CS 161: Design and Analysis of Algorithms
8. Depth and Track Requirements
9. Senior Project not explicitly listed
```

**MS Requirements:**
```
Courses not satisfied:
1. Foundation requirements (CS 103, CS 109, CS 161, CS 107, CS 111)
2. Significant Implementation Requirement course
3. Breadth Requirement (three courses from different areas)
4. AI Depth courses
5. Electives to complete the 45-unit requirement
```

The above analysis confirms that both BS and MS requirements are not fully satisfied based on the given transcript.
