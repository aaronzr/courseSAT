  - Other courses such as **CS 316 (Ethical Hacking)**, **CS 331 (Advanced Machine Learning)** require grading validation.

#### Electives:
- Need to confirm remaining units for electives to meet the 45-unit MSCS requirement.

 ### Summary for MS Requirements
 - **Foundations**: Confirm completion and potential advisor comment for deviations.
 - **Significant Implementation**: Advisor confirmation required.
 - **Breadth Requirement**: Advisor confirmation required.
