Let's begin by analyzing the student's transcript in relation to the BS core, senior project, and AI elective requirements. Here’s a systematic check:

### BS Degree Requirements
1. **Core Requirements (must include)**:
    - CS 107 or 107E
    - CS 111
    - CS 161

2. **Math Requirements**:
    - MATH 19/20/21 (or equivalent): AP Calculus AB is equivalent.
    - CS 103
    - CS 109
    - Two electives from the specified list.

3. **Science Requirements**:
    - PHYS 41
    - PHYS 43
    - One elective from the SoE Science list

4. **Technology in Society Requirement**:
    - One course from the approved TiS list.
  
5. **Engineering Fundamentals**:
    - CS 106B
    - One additional course ENGR 40M or another from the list.

6. **Senior Project Options**:
    - At least 3 units of CS 191, 191W, 194, 194H, 194W, 210B, or 294.

### Verification with Student's Transcript
**Core Requirements:**
- **CS 107**: Not found (CS 200 likely covers some ground but it's not listed in CS 107/111/161).
- **CS 111**: Not found.
- **CS 161**: Found as CS 250 with B- grade in Spring 2022.

**Math Requirements:**
- **MATH 19/20/21**: AP Mathematics is acceptable.
- **CS 103**: Not found.
- **CS 109**: Counted through MATH 130 (Probability Theory) in Spring 2022.
- **Two electives**: Taken (MATH 50, MATH 70).

**Science Requirements:**
- **PHYS 41**: Not found, but PHYSICS 55 (Classical Mechanics) could count but doesn’t explicitly line up.
- **PHYS 43**: Not found. PHYSICS 22 covers Thermodynamics but isn’t listed.
- **Elective**: Mixed biology courses found, but specifics needed.

**Technology in Society:**
- **ETHICS 101** potentially fits under TiS requirement.

**Engineering Fundamentals:**
- **CS106B**: Presumed covered by CS 106C (although listed as Data Structures and Algorithms).
- **Additional Course**: EE 50 (Fundamentals of Electronics).

**Senior Project (Option) Requirements:**
- **AI Capstone Project** found (CS 199, 5.00 units).

### Courses Not Satisfied:
1. **CS Core Requirements**: CS 107, CS 111.
2. **Math Requirements**: CS 103.
3. **Science Requirements**: PHYS 41, PHYS 43.
4. **Technology in Society (TiS)**.

### BS Degree Status: 
**"BS NOT SAT"** because the following courses are unsatisfied: 
- CS 107
- CS 111
- CS 103
- PHYS 41
- PHYS 43
- Technology in Society course

### MS Degree Requirements
1. **Foundations Requirement**:
    - Logic, Automata & Complexity (CS103)
    - Probability (CS109, Stat116, CME106, etc.)
    - Algorithmic Analysis (CS161)
    - Computer Organization & Systems (CS107 or 107E)
    - Principles of Computer Systems (CS110 or CS111)

2. **Significant Implementation Requirement**:
    - Listed courses include CS 140, 143, 144, 145, 148, etc.

3. **Breadth Requirement**:
    - Environmental and Social Context, Mathematical and Theoretical Foundations, Computer Systems, Applications, Computing and Society.

4. **Artificial Intelligence Depth**:
    - CS 221 plus four courses from the list.

### Verification with Student's Transcript for MS Requirements:

**Foundations Requirements:**
- CS103: Not met.
- CS109: Met via MATH 130.
- CS161: Met.
- CS107: Not found.
- CS110/111: Not met.

**Significant Implementation Requirement**:
- None of the listed courses found or clear.

**Breadth Requirement**:
- Need to identify 3 courses from different areas (not all satisfied).

**AI Depth Requirements**:
- CS 221 needed, other AI Depth courses: taken CS 250 (fits under AI electives), CS 199.

### Courses Not Satisfied (MS Requirements):
1. **Foundations Requirements**: CS103, CS107, CS110/CS111.
2. **Significant Implementation Requirement**.
3. **Breadth Requirement** (various specific courses needed).
4. **AI Depth Requirements**: Additional courses needed.

### MS Degree Status:
**"MS NOT SAT"** due to failing to meet:
- Foundations requirements.
- Significant implementation requirement.
- Breadth requirements.
- At least 21 AI depth units not detailed in transcript.

In conclusion, both the BS and MS degree requirements are not satisfied. The student needs to complete several key courses and specializations to fulfil both degrees:
1. Core CS and science courses for the BS.
2. Foundations, breadth, and depth requirements for the MS.
