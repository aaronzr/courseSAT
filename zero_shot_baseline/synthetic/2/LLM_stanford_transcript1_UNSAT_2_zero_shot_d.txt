```

If any inaccuracies are found in the detailed checks or specific standards are clarified later, please adjust accordingly.========================GPT Answer to Prompt Two Regarding MS Requirements====================
Based on the transcript provided for Sophia Marie Perez and the MS requirements for the Artificial Intelligence Specialization in the MSCS program at Stanford University, I will evaluate whether all MS requirements are satisfied.

### Breakdown of Requirements:

#### FOUNDATIONS REQUIREMENT
- **Logic, Automata & Complexity (CS103 or equivalent)**: CS 103 (D+) -  *Not satisfied*
- **Probability (CS109, Stat116, CME106, MS&E220, or EE178)**: CS 109 (D) -  *Not satisfied*
- **Algorithmic Analysis (CS161)**: CS 161 (F) - *Not satisfied*
- **Computer Organization and Systems (CS107 or 107E)**: CS 107 (C+) -  *Satisfied*
- **Principles of Computer Systems (CS110 or CS111)**: CS 110 (C-) and CS 111 (C+) -  *Satisfied*

**Total Units Applied**: Only CS107 and CS110/CS111 courses are used (below the maximum of 10 units). However, several courses have not been passed with satisfactory grades.

#### SIGNIFICANT IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENT
- A course must be taken from the specified list and passed for a letter grade at Stanford. Possible courses are CS 140, 140E, 143, 144, 145, 148, 151, 190, 210B, 212, 221, 227B, etc.
- **CS 221 (Artificial Intelligence: Principles and Techniques)**: F - *Not satisfied*

#### BREADTH REQUIREMENT
- **Area A: Mathematical and Theoretical Foundations**: No course listed. -  *Not satisfied*
- **Area B: Computer Systems**: No course listed. -  *Not satisfied*
- **Area C: Applications**: No course listed (CS124 and CS224N attempted but not passed). -  *Not satisfied*
- **Area D: Computing and Society**: No course listed. -  *Not satisfied*

#### DEPTH REQUIREMENT (Artificial Intelligence Specialization)
- **CS 221 (or waived)**: CS 221 (F) - *Not satisfied*
- **At least four from CS 223A, 224N, 224S, 224U, 224V, 224W, 228, 229, 231A, 231N, 234, 237A, 237B, 238**: Courses CS 224N attempted but failed.
- **Total of at least 21 units from specific categories**: Insufficient courses listed or passed.

#### ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS
- **Electives and additional units to complete 45 units requirement**: Unclear from the transcript whether additional eligible courses have been taken.
- **At least 36 units must be taken for a letter grade**: It is uncertain due to incomplete graduate entries in the transcript.
- **Average grade must be at least a B (3.0 GPA)**: Current cumulative GPA is 2.774 - *Not satisfied (assuming the graduate GPA remains consistent).*

### Courses and Requirements Not Satisfied:
1. **Foundations Requirement**: 
    - Logic, Automata & Complexity: CS103 - Not satisfied (D+)
    - Probability: CS109 - Not satisfied (D)
    - Algorithmic Analysis: CS161 - Not satisfied (F)
2. **Significant Implementation Requirement**: 
    - CS 221 (F)
3. **Breadth Requirement**:
    - Area A, B, C, D: At least one course per area not satisfied.
4. **Artificial Intelligence Depth Requirement**:
    - CS 221 - Not satisfied (F)
    - Four Depth Courses - Not satisfied (no passing depth courses)
5. **Grade Point Average (GPA)**:
    - Minimum GPA of 3.0 not achieved.

### Conclusion:
Sophia Marie Perez does not satisfy the MS requirements. These are the areas that need to be addressed:

1. Retake and pass courses or their equivalents for:
    - Logic, Automata & Complexity
    - Probability
    - Algorithmic Analysis
    - CS 221 or advisor approval for equivalent work

2. Fulfill Significant Implementation through eligible courses.
3. Complete at least one course for each area of Breadth (A, B, C, D).
4. Fulfill total 21 units in depth and other courses, ensuring they are passed.
5. Maintain a GPA of at least 3.0.
