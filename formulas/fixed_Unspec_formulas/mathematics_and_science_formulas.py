# Line 2 appears to be the issue.
# The correct code might be missing some context.
# Assuming it's part of a while-loop structure, let's fix it.

i = 0  # Example initialization for a while loop

while i < 10:  # Correct the syntax and provide a simple loop condition for the example
    print(f"Current value of i: {i}")
    i += 1  # Increment i to avoid an infinite loop

# Add any other logic that was intended within the loop or the module.
