To solve this problem using the Z3 theorem prover in Python, we need to model the constraints and solve for the given conditions. Here is the Python code using the Z3 library to encode the problem and find the solutions for the given conditions:

```python
from z3 import *

# Declare the treatments and their respective categories
treatments = ['F', 'G', 'H', 'M', 'N', 'O', 'U', 'V', 'W']
antibiotics = ['F', 'G', 'H']
dietary_regimens = ['M', 'N', 'O']
physical_therapies = ['U', 'V', 'W']

# Declare the function for treatment prescription
prescribed = {t: Bool(t) for t in treatments}

# Create a solver instance
s = Solver()

# Adding constraints

# Exactly 5 treatments must be prescribed
s.add(Sum([If(prescribed[t], 1, 0) for t in treatments]) == 5)

# At most 2 antibiotics can be prescribed
s.add(Sum([If(prescribed[a], 1, 0) for a in antibiotics]) <= 2)

# Exactly 1 dietary regimen must be prescribed
s.add(Sum([If(prescribed[d], 1, 0) for d in dietary_regimens]) == 1)

# If O is not prescribed, F cannot be prescribed
s.add(Implies(Not(prescribed['O']), Not(prescribed['F'])))

# If W is prescribed, F cannot be prescribed
s.add(Implies(prescribed['W'], Not(prescribed['F'])))

# G cannot be prescribed if both N and U are prescribed
s.add(Implies(And(prescribed['N'], prescribed['U']), Not(prescribed['G'])))

# V cannot be prescribed unless both H and M are prescribed
s.add(Implies(prescribed['V'], And(prescribed['H'], prescribed['M'])))

# Check each option under the condition that O is prescribed
options = {
    'A': And(prescribed['F'], prescribed['M']),
    'B': And(prescribed['G'], prescribed['V']),
    'C': And(prescribed['N'], prescribed['U']),
    'D': And(prescribed['U'], prescribed['V']),
    'E': And(prescribed['U'], prescribed['W'])
}

# Add the condition that O is prescribed
s.add(prescribed['O'])

for option, condition in options.items():
    s.push()
    s.add(condition)
    if s.check() == sat:
        print(f'Option {option} is a valid pair of treatments if O is prescribed.')
    else:
        print(f'Option {option} is not a valid pair of treatments if O is prescribed.')
    s.pop()
```

This code uses the Z3 library to encode the constraints and check the potential pairs of treatments when `O` is prescribed. The code checks each option `(A, B, C, D, E)` and prints whether each pair of treatments satisfies the constraints. 

To run this code, make sure you have the Z3 library installed. You can install Z3 via pip if you don't already have it:

```sh
pip install z3-solver
```

Then run the code in your Python environment to see the results.
