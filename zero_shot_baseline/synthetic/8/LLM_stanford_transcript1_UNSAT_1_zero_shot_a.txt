==========================================### Analysis of Transcript for BS Requirements

#### BS Core Requirements
The core requirements for a BS in Computer Science are:

1. **Systems Core:**
   - CS103: Mathematical Foundations of Computing
   - CS109: Introduction to Probability for Computer Scientists
   - CS107 or 107E: Computer Organization and Systems
   - CS111: Operating Systems Principles
   - CS161: Design and Analysis of Algorithms

2. **Additional Mathematics Courses:**
   - MATH 19, 20, 21 (or equivalent)
   - Electives (Math 51, 52, 53, 104, 107, 108, 109, 110, 113; CS 157, 205L; PHIL 151; CME 100, 102, 104; ENGR 108)

3. **Science Requirements:**
   - PHYS 41: Mechanics (or equivalent)
   - PHYS 43: Electricity and Magnetism (or equivalent)
   - Additional elective from SoE Science list, PSYCH 30, or AP Chemistry

4. **Technology in Society:**
   - 1 course from the approved list

5. **Engineering Fundamentals:**
   - CS106B: Programming Abstractions
   - ENGR40M or 76: An Intro to Making: What is EE? or Information Science

6. **Senior Project:**
   - One senior project course (CS194, CS194W, CS210B, CS191, CS191W)

#### Transcript Analysis
My analysis of the studentâ€™s transcript is as follows:

1. **Systems Core Courses Taken:**
   - CS103 (Mathematical Foundations of Computing) - Requirement not satisfied: CS103 is not listed on the transcript.
   - CS109 (Introduction to Probability) - Requirement satisfied.
   - CS107 (Computer Organization) - Requirement not satisfied: Student has taken EE101 which is not equivalent to CS107.
   - CS111 (Operating Systems Principles): Taken as CS202 - Requirement satisfied.
   - CS161 (Design and Analysis of Algorithms): Taken as CS201 - Requirement satisfied.

2. **Mathematics Courses:**
   - MATH 19/20/21 or equivalents: 
     - The transcript includes MATH 41 (Calculus I) and MATH 42 (Calculus II), but the equivalent courses to MATH 19, 20, and 21 are not explicitly clear from the provided transcript.
   - Electives:
     - MATH 51 (Linear Algebra), MATH 121 (Differential Geometry), MATH 113 (Intro to Complex Variables) - Requirement satisfied.

3. **Science Courses:**
   - PHYS 41 (Mechanics): Equivalent not explicit in transcript.
   - PHYS 43 (Electricity and Magnetism): Taken as PHYS 102.
   - Additional elective (one from SoE Science list, PSYCH 30, or AP Chemistry): Requirements met via BIO 101, BIO 102.

4. **Technology in Society:**
   - Not explicitly mentioned in the transcript.

5. **Engineering Fundamentals:**
   - CS106B: Programming Abstractions taken as CS102 (Data Structures) - Requirement conditionally satisfied if treated as equivalent.
   - ENGR40M or 76: Not explicitly listed. ENGR 10 might cover basics, but no direct match.

6. **Senior Project:**
   - CS306 fulfills senior project and writing requirement if washed as Approved (AI).

#### Result for BS Degree
- **BS NOT SAT**: Below requirements not explicitly satisfied:
  - CS103: Mathematical Foundations of Computing
  - CS106B or equivalent clearly not demarcated.
  - Technology in Society: Unlisted.
  - CS107 or equivalent clearly demarcated.

### Analysis for MS Requirements
#### MS Artificial Intelligence Specialization
To verify the MS satisfaction status, a detailed program sheet covers the:
1. **Foundations Requirement:**
   - Logic, Automata & Complexity
   - Probability
   - Algorithmic Analysis
   - Computer Organization & Systems
   - Principles of Computer Systems

2. **Significant Implementation Requirement:**
   - One course from defined list.

3. **Breadth Requirement:**
   - One course from three different breadth areas (A, B, C, or D).

4. **AI Depth:**
   - CS 221
   - Four from defined list
   - Total of 21 units from a set list.

5. **Additional Electives:**
   - Until 45 units met.

#### Transcript Analysis
- Most courses for the MS specialization are missing from the undergraduate transcript provided. Verification and satisfaction analyses cannot be drawn without the incumbent MS progression transcript data.

### Summary Outcome
- **BS Status**: **BS NOT SAT** due to core requirement gaps.
- **MS Status**: Verification unavailable due to incomplete graduate-level transcript details.

Further confirmation and completion of outstanding requisites are necessary to solidify degrees as dialoged aboveâ€”pending course sign-off.
