### Define the CVC5 Solver and Variables

```python
from cvc5 import Solver, Kind

solver = Solver()
solver.setLogic("QF_UF")  # Quantifier-free logic with uninterpreted functions

# Declare functions (predicates)
big = solver.declareFun("big", [solver.getType("Int")], solver.getBoolSort())  # big(x)
chases = solver.declareFun("chases", [solver.getType("Int"), solver.getType("Int")], solver.getBoolSort())  # chases(x, y)
rough = solver.declareFun("rough", [solver.getType("Int")], solver.getBoolSort())  # rough(x)
eats = solver.declareFun("eats", [solver.getType("Int"), solver.getType("Int")], solver.getBoolSort())  # eats(x, y)
likes = solver.declareFun("likes", [solver.getType("Int"), solver.getType("Int")], solver.getBoolSort())  # likes(x, y)
nice = solver.declareFun("nice", [solver.getType("Int")], solver.getBoolSort())  # nice(x)
round = solver.declareFun("round", [solver.getType("Int")], solver.getBoolSort())  # round(x)

# Declare individual constants for each object
cow = solver.mkConst(solver.getType("Int"), "cow")
dog = solver.mkConst(solver.getType("Int"), "dog")
bear = solver.mkConst(solver.getType("Int"), "bear")
mouse = solver.mkConst(solver.getType("Int"), "mouse")
```

### Contextual Statements as Formulas

```python
# 1. If something is big then it chases the dog.
x = solver.mkVar(solver.getType("Int"))
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkImplies(big(x), chases(x, dog)))

# 2. If the cow is rough and the cow chases the dog then the dog is nice.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkImplies(solver.mkAnd(rough(cow), chases(cow, dog)), nice(dog)))

# 3. If something chases the cow then the cow eats the bear.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkImplies(chases(x, cow), eats(cow, bear)))

# 4. If something eats the dog then the dog likes the cow.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkImplies(eats(x, dog), likes(dog, cow)))

# 5. If something eats the cow then it likes the dog.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkImplies(eats(x, cow), likes(x, dog)))

# 6. Nice things are rough.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkForall([x], solver.mkImplies(nice(x), rough(x))))

# 7. If the bear is round and the bear likes the cow then the cow eats the mouse.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkImplies(solver.mkAnd(round(bear), likes(bear, cow)), eats(cow, mouse)))

# 8. All nice things are big.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkForall([x], solver.mkImplies(nice(x), big(x))))

# 9. If something is rough and it eats the cow then it is round.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkImplies(solver.mkAnd(rough(x), eats(x, cow)), round(x)))

# 10. The bear chases the cow.
solver.assertFormula(chases(bear, cow))

# 11. The bear is nice.
solver.assertFormula(nice(bear))

# 12. The cow chases the bear.
solver.assertFormula(chases(cow, bear))

# 13. The cow chases the mouse.
solver.assertFormula(chases(cow, mouse))

# 14. The cow eats the bear.
solver.assertFormula(eats(cow, bear))

# 15. The cow is nice.
solver.assertFormula(nice(cow))

# 16. The dog eats the cow.
solver.assertFormula(eats(dog, cow))

# 17. The dog eats the mouse.
solver.assertFormula(eats(dog, mouse))

# 18. The dog is blue (This doesn't concern our logic and we can skip this line for now).
# 19. The dog is round.
solver.assertFormula(round(dog))

# 20. The mouse chases the bear.
solver.assertFormula(chases(mouse, bear))

# 21. The mouse eats the bear.
solver.assertFormula(eats(mouse, bear))
```

### Test Statement

```python
# The dog is not nice.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkNot(nice(dog)))
```

### Check Satisfiability

```python
result = solver.checkSat()
print("Satisfiability:", result.isSat())

if not result.isSat():
    print("The dog is not nice is UNSATISFIABLE given the context.")
else:
    print("The dog is not nice is SATISFIABLE given the context.")
```

You can run this block of code in a Python environment with the CVC5 solver installed to check the satisfiability of "The dog is not nice." given the contextual statements.
