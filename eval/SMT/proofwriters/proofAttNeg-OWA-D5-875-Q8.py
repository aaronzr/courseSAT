['Green, blue things are young.', 'If something is furry and young then it is nice.', 'All big, round things are nice.', 'All nice, blue things are green.', 'If something is green and young then it is not furry.', 'If Harry is young then Harry is nice.', 'Big things are blue.', 'Big things are round.', 'Anne is big.', 'Bob is big.', 'Bob is blue.', 'Bob is young.', 'Fiona is round.', 'Fiona is young.', 'Harry is not big.', 'Harry is blue.', 'Harry is nice.', 'Harry is not round.', 'Harry is young.']Bob is not green.Certainly! Below is a translation of each statement into CVC5 SMT formulas using the CVC5 Python API.

First, we'll import the necessary libraries and create a solver instance.

```python
import cvc5
from cvc5 import Solver, Term, Kind

# Initialize the SMT solver
solver = Solver()
solver.setLogic("QF_UF")  # Default logic for this kind of problem
solver.setOption("produce-models", "true")

# Define sorts
Bool = solver.getBooleanSort()

# Declare variables and predicates
green = solver.mkPredicate("green", (solver.getSort("Person"), Bool))
blue = solver.mkPredicate("blue", (solver.getSort("Person"), Bool))
young = solver.mkPredicate("young", (solver.getSort("Person"), Bool))
furry = solver.mkPredicate("furry", (solver.getSort("Person"), Bool))
nice = solver.mkPredicate("nice", (solver.getSort("Person"), Bool))
big = solver.mkPredicate("big", (solver.getSort("Person"), Bool))
round = solver.mkPredicate("round", (solver.getSort("Person"), Bool))
Anne = solver.mkConst(solver.getSort("Person"), "Anne")
Bob = solver.mkConst(solver.getSort("Person"), "Bob")
Fiona = solver.mkConst(solver.getSort("Person"), "Fiona")
Harry = solver.mkConst(solver.getSort("Person"), "Harry")

# Define the statements
statements = [
    solver.mkForall([x], solver.mkImply(solver.mkAnd(green(x), blue(x)), young(x))),
    solver.mkForall([x], solver.mkImply(solver.mkAnd(furry(x), young(x)), nice(x))),
    solver.mkForall([x], solver.mkImply(solver.mkAnd(big(x), round(x)), nice(x))),
    solver.mkForall([x], solver.mkImply(solver.mkAnd(nice(x), blue(x)), green(x))),
    solver.mkForall([x], solver.mkImply(solver.mkAnd(green(x), young(x)), solver.mkNot(furry(x)))),
    solver.mkImply(young(Harry), nice(Harry)),
    solver.mkForall([x], solver.mkImply(big(x), blue(x))),
    solver.mkForall([x], solver.mkImply(big(x), round(x))),
    big(Anne),
    big(Bob),
    blue(Bob),
    young(Bob),
    round(Fiona),
    young(Fiona),
    solver.mkNot(big(Harry)),
    blue(Harry),
    nice(Harry),
    solver.mkNot(round(Harry)),
    young(Harry),
]

for stmt in statements:
    solver.assertFormula(stmt)

# Define the test statement: Bob is not green.
test_statement = solver.mkNot(green(Bob))
solver.assertFormula(test_statement)
```

Letâ€™s evaluate whether the test statement is satisfied or unsatisfied.

```python
# Check consistency
if solver.checkSat().isUnsat():
    print("Unsatisfied")
else:
    print("Satisfied")
```

This code initializes a solver, declares sorts, variables, and predicates, translates each contextual statement into a formula, asserts these formulas, and finally asserts the test statement. We then check whether combining all these statements leads to a satisfiable or unsatisfiable formula according to Bob not being green.

You can run this code with the proper setup of the CVC5 library in your environment to check the satisfaction of the test statement.
