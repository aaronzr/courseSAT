Sure, I'll translate each of the given statements into cvc5 SMT python formulas. We'll start by defining each individual and the predicates being used.

### Boilerplate Code and Declaration of Solver and Variables
```python
import cvc5

# Initialize cvc5 solver
solver = cvc5.Solver()

# Define sorts
Bool = solver.getBoolSort()

# Define individuals
Bob = solver.mkConst(Bool, 'Bob')
Charlie = solver.mkConst(Bool, 'Charlie')
Gary = solver.mkConst(Bool, 'Gary')
Harry = solver.mkConst(Bool, 'Harry')

# Define predicates
isRed = solver.mkPredicate(1, Bool, 'isRed')
isRound = solver.mkPredicate(1, Bool, 'isRound')
isSmart = solver.mkPredicate(1, Bool, 'isSmart')
isCold = solver.mkPredicate(1, Bool, 'isCold')
isRough = solver.mkPredicate(1, Bool, 'isRough')
isYoung = solver.mkPredicate(1, Bool, 'isYoung')
isWhite = solver.mkPredicate(1, Bool, 'isWhite')
```

### Contextual Statements
1. **All red people are round.**
```python
# ∀x. isRed(x) → isRound(x)
x = solver.mkVar(Bool, 'x')
redImpliesRound = solver.mkForall([x], solver.mkTerm(solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Term.Kind.IMPLIES,
                                      isRed(x),
                                      isRound(x))))
solver.assertFormula(redImpliesRound)
```

2. **Round, smart people are cold.**
```python
# ∀x. (isRound(x) ∧ isSmart(x)) → isCold(x)
roundSmartImpliesCold = solver.mkForall([x], solver.mkTerm(solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Term.Kind.IMPLIES,
                                      solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Term.Kind.AND, isRound(x), isSmart(x)),
                                      isCold(x))))
solver.assertFormula(roundSmartImpliesCold)
```

3. **If someone is cold and young then they are white.**
```python
# ∀x. (isCold(x) ∧ isYoung(x)) → isWhite(x)
coldYoungImpliesWhite = solver.mkForall([x], solver.mkTerm(solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Term.Kind.IMPLIES,
                                      solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Term.Kind.AND, isCold(x), isYoung(x)),
                                      isWhite(x))))
solver.assertFormula(coldYoungImpliesWhite)
```

4. **Red people are round.**
```python
# ∀x. isRed(x) → isRound(x) (Already included in statement 1, no need to repeat)
```

5. **All round, young people are red.**
```python
# ∀x. (isRound(x) ∧ isYoung(x)) → isRed(x)
roundYoungImpliesRed = solver.mkForall([x], solver.mkTerm(solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Term.Kind.IMPLIES,
                                      solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Term.Kind.AND, isRound(x), isYoung(x)),
                                      isRed(x))))
solver.assertFormula(roundYoungImpliesRed)
```

6. **If someone is smart then they are rough.**
```python
# ∀x. isSmart(x) → isRough(x)
smartImpliesRough = solver.mkForall([x], solver.mkTerm(solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Term.Kind.IMPLIES,
                                      isSmart(x),
                                      isRough(x))))
solver.assertFormula(smartImpliesRough)
```

7. **Rough, young people are red.**
```python
# ∀x. (isRough(x) ∧ isYoung(x)) → isRed(x)
roughYoungImpliesRed = solver.mkForall([x], solver.mkTerm(solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Term.Kind.IMPLIES,
                                      solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Term.Kind.AND, isRough(x), isYoung(x)),
                                      isRed(x))))
solver.assertFormula(roughYoungImpliesRed)
```

8. **If Bob is round then Bob is smart.**
```python
# isRound(Bob) → isSmart(Bob)
bobRoundImpliesSmart = solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Term.Kind.IMPLIES, isRound(Bob), isSmart(Bob))
solver.assertFormula(bobRoundImpliesSmart)
```

9. **If Charlie is white and Charlie is rough then Charlie is young.**
```python
# (isWhite(Charlie) ∧ isRough(Charlie)) → isYoung(Charlie)
charlieWhiteRoughImpliesYoung = solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Term.Kind.IMPLIES, 
                                       solver.mkTerm(cvc5.Term.Kind.AND, isWhite(Charlie), isRough(Charlie)),
                                       isYoung(Charlie))
solver.assertFormula(charlieWhiteRoughImpliesYoung)
```

10. **Bob is smart.**
```python
solver.assertFormula(isSmart(Bob))
```

11. **Bob is young.**
```python
solver.assertFormula(isYoung(Bob))
```

12. **Charlie is cold.**
```python
solver.assertFormula(isCold(Charlie))
```

13. **Charlie is round.**
```python
solver.assertFormula(isRound(Charlie))
```

14. **Charlie is white.**
```python
solver.assertFormula(isWhite(Charlie))
```

15. **Charlie is young.**
```python
solver.assertFormula(isYoung(Charlie))
```

16. **Gary is smart.**
```python
solver.assertFormula(isSmart(Gary))
```

17. **Gary is white.**
```python
solver.assertFormula(isWhite(Gary))
```

18. **Harry is rough.**
```python
solver.assertFormula(isRough(Harry))
```

19. **Harry is smart.**
```python
solver.assertFormula(isSmart(Harry))
```

20. **Harry is white.**
```python
solver.assertFormula(isWhite(Harry))
```

### Test Statement: "Gary is rough."
```python
# Check if Gary is rough
garyIsRough = isRough(Gary)
result = solver.checkSatAssuming(garyIsRough)
print(f"Is Gary rough? {result.isSat()}")
```

Now, use this code to evaluate the test statement "Gary is rough." by running the above script. Adjust any specific function calls or method signatures based on the exact cvc5 Python API available in your environment.
