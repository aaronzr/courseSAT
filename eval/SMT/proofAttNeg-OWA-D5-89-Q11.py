```python
import cvc5
from cvc5 import Kind

# Initialize the Solver
solver = cvc5.Solver()
solver.setLogic("QF_UF")

# Define sorts
Person = solver.mkUninterpretedSort("Person")
Boolean = solver.getBooleanSort()

# Define people as constants
Anne = solver.mkConst(Person, "Anne")
Charlie = solver.mkConst(Person, "Charlie")
Dave = solver.mkConst(Person, "Dave")
Gary = solver.mkConst(Person, "Gary")

# Define predicates
green = solver.mkPredicate(Person, "green")
red = solver.mkPredicate(Person, "red")
smart = solver.mkPredicate(Person, "smart")
furry = solver.mkPredicate(Person, "furry")
big = solver.mkPredicate(Person, "big")
blue = solver.mkPredicate(Person, "blue")
quiet = solver.mkPredicate(Person, "quiet")

# Contextual statements
contextual_statements = [
    solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, green(Anne), red(Anne)), solver.mkTerm(Kind.NOT, smart(Anne))), # If someone is green and red then they are not smart.
    solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, furry(Anne), red(Anne)), # If someone is furry then they are red.
    solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, green(Anne), big(Anne)), # If Anne is green then Anne is big.
    solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, blue(Anne), big(Anne)), furry(Anne)), # Blue, big people are furry.
    solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, furry(Anne), green(Anne)), # If someone is furry then they are green.
    solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, red(Anne), big(Anne)), quiet(Anne)), # Red, big people are quiet.
    solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, red(Anne), quiet(Anne)), blue(Anne)), # Red, quiet people are blue.
    solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, red(Dave), green(Dave)), # If Dave is red then Dave is green.
    solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, red(Charlie), quiet(Charlie)), blue(Charlie)), # If Charlie is red and Charlie is quiet then Charlie is blue.
    big(Anne), # Anne is big.
    red(Anne), # Anne is red.
    solver.mkTerm(Kind.NOT, big(Charlie)), # Charlie is not big.
    solver.mkTerm(Kind.NOT, blue(Charlie)), # Charlie is not blue.
    solver.mkTerm(Kind.NOT, green(Charlie)), # Charlie is not green.
    blue(Dave), # Dave is blue.
    green(Dave), # Dave is green.
    blue(Gary), # Gary is blue.
    furry(Gary), # Gary is furry.
    solver.mkTerm(Kind.NOT, quiet(Gary)) # Gary is not quiet.
]

# Assert all contextual statements in the solver
for stmt in contextual_statements:
    solver.assertFormula(stmt)

# Test statement: Anne is not smart.
test_statement = solver.mkTerm(Kind.NOT, smart(Anne))

# Check satisfiability and print result
result = solver.checkSatAssuming(test_statement)
print(f"Is 'Anne is not smart' satisfied? {result}")

# Run the test
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The above code sets up the CVC5 solver with the contextual statements and the test statement "Anne is not smart." It then checks whether the test statement is satisfied given the contextual statements.

Note: The exact CVC5 Python API might differ slightly and some manual adjustments may be needed based on the exact version and setup of the CVC5 package installed. This code assumes the use of a generic SMT logic for symbolic reasoning.
