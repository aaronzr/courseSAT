To ascertain if Sandra Marie Lewinsky satisfies the BS and MS degree requirements, we will evaluate her transcript against the given degree requirements for the BS in Computer Science with an AI specialization and the MS in Computer Science with an Artificial Intelligence Specialization.

Let's start with the BS requirements.

### BS Degree Evaluation

#### Core Requirements
1. **CS 106B** Programming Abstractions: Not listed.
2. **CS 103** Mathematical Foundations of Computing: Attempted but withdrew.
3. **CS 107** Computer Organization and Systems: Taken and passed with B+.
4. **CS 111** Principles of Computer Systems: Not listed.
5. **CS 109** Introduction to Probability for Computer Scientists: Taken and passed with A-.
6. **CS 161** Data Structures and Algorithms: Not listed.

#### Senior Project
- **CS 191 or equivalent senior project course**: Not listed.

#### Mathematics Requirements
1. **MATH 19/20/21, or equivalent courses**: Calculus AB AP credit,
    MATH 51 (B+),
    MATH 52 (A-).
2. **CS 103**: Attempted but withdrew.
3. **CS 109**: Taken and passed with A-.
4. **Two electives**:
   - MATH 53 (C+),
   - MATH 104 (C),
   - MATH 108 (A).

#### Science Requirements
1. **PHYS 41/21/61, or equivalent courses**: Taken and passed with B and C+.
2. **PHYS 43/23/81/63, or equivalent courses**: Not specifically listed.
3. **One elective**:
    - PHYS 45 (B+).

#### Technology in Society Requirement: Not explicitly evaluated based on provided transcript.

#### Engineering Fundamentals
1. **CS 106B**: Not listed.
2. **ENGR 40M or 76**: Not listed.

#### Depth and AI Electives
1. **CS 221**: Not listed.
2. Two courses from different areas (AI Methods, NLP, Vision, Robotics):
   - Not listed.
3. One additional course:
   - Not listed.
4. Three additional electives:
   - Not listed.

#### Minimum GPA
- Must have 2.0 GPA for ENGR Fundamentals, CS Core/Depth/Senior Project: GPA checking must address specific requirement areas.

Overall, Sandra appears to be lacking several core requirements, senior project, and depth electives for her BS in AI Track. Here are the missing BS requirements:
1. CS 106B
2. CS 103
3. CS 111
4. CS 161
5. Senior Project (CS 191 or equivalent)
6. PHYS 43/23/81/63
7. ENGR Fundamental (CS 106B again)
8. Technology in Society course
9. Depth and AI Electives courses

As Sandra's transcript currently stands, she does **not** satisfy all BS requirements.
Output: **BS NOT SAT** with the missing courses listed above.

### MS Degree Evaluation

Given that Sandra has not satisfied her BS degree requirements, the evaluation for the MS degree would typically defer. However, for thoroughness, let's hypothetically evaluate her MS requirements:

#### Foundations Requirement
1. **Logic, Automata, Complexity (CS 103)**: Attempted but withdrew.
2. **Probability (CS 109)**: Passed with A-.
3. **Algorithmic Analysis (CS 161)**: Not listed.
4. **Computer Organization and Systems (CS 107)**: Passed with B+.
5. **Principles of Computer Systems (CS 111)**: Not listed.

#### Significant Implementation Requirement
- Requires to be noted in later evaluation (CS 140, 143, 144, 145, 148, 151, etc.): Not mentioned in transcript explicitly.

#### Breadth Requirement
- Three regional areas not overlapping and must list specific courses: None identified yet.

#### AI Depth
1. **CS 221**: Not listed.
2. Four of other core AI electives: None listed.
   
Total depth & electives courses broader in AI specialization not satisfied.

#### Electives
- No specific extra elective courses identified in current transcript that meet MS criteria (excludes CS 196, 198, 390A/B/C).

#### Minimum GPA
- Average grade must be at least a B (3.0). Current cumulative GPA is 3.091, which meets overall GPA criteria but specific required courses remain incomplete.

Since the BS is not satisfied, **MS** requirements are inherently **not satisfied**. Output: **MS NOT SAT** with similar lists needed to be identified within more specific advanced coursework indications.

Sandra Marie Lewinsky will need to complete the missing BS core, elective, and significant project criteria to possibly proceed into satisfying details within the MS AI Specialization.
