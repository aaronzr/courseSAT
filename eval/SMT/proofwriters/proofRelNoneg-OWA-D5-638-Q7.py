To do this, we must define the necessary variables and their relationships as shown in the statements given.

```python
import cvc5
from cvc5 import Kind

# Initialize solver
solver = cvc5.Solver()

# Define Boolean variables for each predicate
Eats = solver.mkFunction(solver.mkBooleanSort(), solver.mkBooleanSort(), solver.mkBooleanSort(), "Eats")
Chases = solver.mkFunction(solver.mkBooleanSort(), solver.mkBooleanSort(), "Chases")
Visits = solver.mkFunction(solver.mkBooleanSort(), solver.mkBooleanSort(), "Visits")

squirrel = solver.mkBoolean('squirrel')
cow = solver.mkBoolean('cow')
bear = solver.mkBoolean('bear')
cat = solver.mkBoolean('cat')
someone = solver.mkBoolean('someone')

is_rough = solver.mkFunction(squirrel, solver.mkBoolean(), "is_rough")
is_young = solver.mkFunction(cat, solver.mkBoolean(), "is_young")
is_red = solver.mkFunction(cow, solver.mkBoolean(), "is_red")
is_big = solver.mkFunction(someone, solver.mkBoolean(), "is_big")

# Contextual statements in CVC5 SMT format

# 1. If someone eats the squirrel and the squirrel is rough then the squirrel eats the cow.
statement1 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES,
                          solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, Eats(someone, squirrel), is_rough(squirrel)),
                          Eats(squirrel, cow))

# 2. If someone eats the squirrel then they chase the squirrel.
statement2 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES,
                          Eats(someone, squirrel),
                          Chases(someone, squirrel))

# 3. If someone chases the squirrel then they chase the bear.
statement3 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES,
                          Chases(someone, squirrel),

# 5. If someone eats the cat and the cat chases the cow then the cat visits the cow.
statement5 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES,
                          solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, Eats(someone, cat), Chases(cat, cow)),
                          Visits(cat, cow))

# 6. If someone chases the bear then the bear eats the squirrel.
statement6 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES,
                          Chases(someone, bear),
                          Eats(bear, squirrel))

# 7. If someone chases the bear and the bear chases the squirrel then they chase the cat.

# 8. If the cat is young and the cat is rough then the cat is red.
statement8 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES,
                          solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, is_young(cat), is_rough(cat)),
                          is_red(cat))

# 9. If someone eats the cow then they are big.
statement9 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES,
                          Eats(someone, cow),
                          is_big(someone))

# 10. The bear chases the cow.
statement10 = Chases(bear, cow)

# 11. The bear is cold.
statement11 = is_cold(bear)

# 12. The bear is young.
statement12 = is_young(bear)

# 13. The cat eats the cow.
statement13 = Eats(cat, cow)

# 14. The cat eats the squirrel.
statement14 = Eats(cat, squirrel)

# 15. The cow is red.
statement15 = is_red(cow)

# 16. The squirrel eats the cow.
statement16 = Eats(squirrel, cow)

# Define all the given contextual statements
contextual_statements = [
    statement1,
    statement2,
    statement3,
    statement4,
    statement5,
    statement6,
    statement7,
    statement8,
    statement9,
    statement10,
    statement11,
    statement12,
    statement13,
    statement14,

    statement16
]

# Assert all statements to the solver
for stmt in contextual_statements:
    solver.assertFormula(stmt)

# Test statement
test_statement = Eats(bear, squirrel)

# Check if the test statement is satisfied
is_satisfied = solver.checkSatAssuming(test_statement)

print(f"The statement 'The bear eats the squirrel.' is {is_satisfied}.")
```

The above code translates each of the given contextual statements and the test statement into CVC5-compatible formulas. It initializes the CVC5 solver, defines the necessary variables and predicates, and asserts the contextual statements. Finally, it checks whether the test statement "The bear eats the squirrel." is satisfied or not.
