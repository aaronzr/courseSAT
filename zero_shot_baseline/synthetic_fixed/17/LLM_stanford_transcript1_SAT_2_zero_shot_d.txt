```========================GPT Answer to Prompt Two Regarding MS Requirements====================
To determine if the student, Alexandra Marie Smith, has satisfied the Master of Science (MS) degree requirements in Artificial Intelligence Specialization, we need to compare her coursework with the specified requirements.

### 1. Foundations Requirement:
- **Logic, Automata & Complexity (CS103)**: Taken with a B+ grade.
- **Probability (CS109, Stat116, CME106, MS&E220, or EE178)**: CS 109 taken with an A- grade.
- **Algorithmic Analysis (CS161)**: Taken with a B+ grade.
- **Computer Organ & Sys (CS107 or 107E)**: CS 107 taken with a B grade.
- **Principles of Computer Systems (CS110 or CS111)**: CS 111 taken with a B+ grade.

### 2. Significant Implementation Requirement:
- **At least one of the listed courses**: CS 210B (Project Experience with Corporate Partners) was taken and is on the list. Grade B+.

### 3. Breadth Requirement:
- **Three courses from different Areas A, B, C, or D**:

  - **Area A (Mathematical and Theoretical Foundations)**: CS 257 (Logic and Automated Reasoning) taken with A-.
  - **Area B (Computer Systems)**: CS 243 (Programming Languages) taken with B+.
  - **Area C (Applications)**: CS 221 (Artificial Intelligence: Principles and Techniques) taken with A-.

### 4. Depth Requirement:
At least 21 units from categories (a), (b), and the specific list provided:

  - **a) CS 221**: Taken, 3 units, A-.
  - **b) At least four courses from the specified list**:
    - CS 224N: 3 units, B+.
    - CS 228: 4 units, A.
    - CS 234: 3 units, A-
    - CS 237A: 3 units, A.

  - **Units total in depth courses**:
    - CS 221: 3 units
    - CS 224N: 3 units
    - CS 228: 4 units
    - CS 234: 3 units
    - CS 237A: 3 units
    - Additional CS 229, CS 239, CS 279: Total additional 10 units (4+3+3)

    Total depth units = 3 + 3 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 3 + 3 = 23 units (satisfies the 21-unit requirement)

### 5. Electives to meet the 45-unit requirement:
Assuming the other electives meet the additional unit and course listing requirements. The transcript shows multiple other courses taken with appropriate grades and units.

### 6. Additional Requirements:
- **At least 36 units taken for a letter grade**: Met based on breadth and depth courses alone.
- **Average grade of at least a B (3.0 GPA)**: The cumulative GPA is 3.633, satisfying this requirement.
- **Units previously applied toward BS requirements may not also be counted toward the MSCS**: No evidence that the critical foundations or depth requirements overlap with previous BS requirements.
- **Completion of at least 45 graduate units at Stanford before receiving the MSCS degree**: Based on data provided, graduate units are not explicitly calculated but inferred total units above 45.

Based on the provided data and analysis:
