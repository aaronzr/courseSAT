Sure, let's go through each statement and translate it into a corresponding CVC5 SMT formula in Python. This will help us set up the SMT solver to evaluate the test statement. 

To do this, we'll need to:
1. Define the necessary boolean variables.
2. Encode the contextual statements using SMT constraints.
3. Add the test statement as a query.

Here is the CVC5 code:

```python
import cvc5
from cvc5 import Kind

# Create an SMT solver instance
solver = cvc5.Solver()

# Declare boolean variables for each property and individual
Fiona_cold = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), "Fiona_cold")
Fiona_young = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), "Fiona_young")
Fiona_quiet = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), "Fiona_quiet")
Fiona_kind = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), "Fiona_kind")

Dave_smart = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), "Dave_smart")
Dave_cold = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), "Dave_cold")
Dave_kind = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), "Dave_kind")
Dave_red = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), "Dave_red")

Charlie_cold = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), "Charlie_cold")
Charlie_quiet = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), "Charlie_quiet")

Harry_kind = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), "Harry_kind")
Harry_young = solver.mkConst(solver.getBooleanSort(), "Harry_young")

# Universal variables
x = solver.mkVar(solver.getBooleanSort(), "x")

# Contextual statements encoded as SMT formulas
# If Fiona is cold and Fiona is young then Fiona is quiet.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, 
                                   solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, Fiona_cold, Fiona_young), 
                                   Fiona_quiet))

# All red things are quiet.
red = solver.mkTerm(solver.getBooleanSort())  # universal variable for red things
quiet = solver.mkTerm(solver.getBooleanSort())  # universal variable for quiet things
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(Kind.FORALL, [red],  # ∀x. red(x) → quiet(x)
                                   solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, red, quiet)))

# If something is smart and kind then it is young.
smart = solver.mkTerm(solver.getBooleanSort())  # universal variable for smart things
kind = solver.mkTerm(solver.getBooleanSort())  # universal variable for kind things
young = solver.mkTerm(solver.getBooleanSort())  # universal variable for young things
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(Kind.FORALL, [x],  # ∀x. smart(x) ∧ kind(x) → young(x)
                                   solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, 
                                                 solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, smart, kind),
                                                 young)))

# If something is young and cold then it is red.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(Kind.FORALL, [x],  # ∀x. young(x) ∧ cold(x) → red(x)
                                   solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, 
                                                 solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, young, cold),
                                                 red)))

# If something is smart then it is red.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(Kind.FORALL, [x],  # ∀x. smart(x) → red(x)
                                   solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, smart, red)))

# If something is quiet then it is kind.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(Kind.FORALL, [x],  # ∀x. quiet(x) → kind(x)
                                   solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, quiet, kind)))

# If Dave is smart and Dave is not cold then Dave is kind.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, 
                                   solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, Dave_smart, solver.mkTerm(Kind.NOT, Dave_cold)), 
                                   Dave_kind))

# Young, smart things are white.
# This statement is not clearly defined as white, thus not translatable

# Charlie is cold.
solver.assertFormula(Charlie_cold)

# Charlie is quiet.
solver.assertFormula(Charlie_quiet)

# Dave is cold.
solver.assertFormula(Dave_cold)

# Dave is smart.
solver.assertFormula(Dave_smart)

# Fiona is not kind.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(Kind.NOT, Fiona_kind))

# Harry is not kind.
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(Kind.NOT, Harry_kind))

# Harry is young.
solver.assertFormula(Harry_young)

# Add the test statement: Dave is red.
test_query = solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, Dave_red)

# Check if the test query is satisfied
result = solver.checkSatAssuming(test_query)

print("Result:", result.isSat())
```

Note:
- CVC5 preliminary setup: We need suitable universal variables and boolean variables representing the given properties. 
- Assertion of contextual statements: Some properties require universal quantifiers.
- The last block checks if "Dave is red." is true given these constraints.

To execute this code, you need to have the CVC5 SMT solver installed and correctly set up in your environment. This script will indicate whether "Dave is red." given the contextual information provided.
