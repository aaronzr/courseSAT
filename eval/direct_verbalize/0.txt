The given SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) formula can be translated into the following natural language description:

To satisfy the criteria:

1. You must select three distinct courses, denoted as course_a, course_b, and course_c.

2. For course_a, one of the following conditions must be met:
   - If course_a is "CME 100" and has at least 5 units, your grade must be "B".
   - If course_a is "CME 102", "CME 104", or "CS 106B" and has at least 5 units, your grade must be "A-" or higher.
   - If course_a is "CME 106" and has at least 4 units, your grade must be "B+" or higher.
   - If course_a belongs to one of the following: "CS 154", "CS 157", "CS 168", "CS 254", "CS 261", "CS 265", "EE 364A", "EE 364B", "Phil 251" with at least 3 units, then the course qualifies

3. For course_b, one of the following conditions must be met:
   - If course_b is "CME 100" and has at least 5 units, your grade must be "B".
   - If course_b is "CME 102", "CME 104", or "CS 106B" and has at least 5 units, your grade must be "A-" or higher.
   - If course_b is "CME 106" and has at least 4 units, your grade must be "B+" or higher.
   - If course_b belongs to one of the following: "CS 140", "CS 140E", "CS 143", "CS 144", "CS 149", "CS 212", "CS 242", "CS 243", "CS 244", "CS 244B", "CS 295", "CS 316", "CS 358", "EE 180", "EE 282", "EE 382E" with at least 3 units, then the course qualifies.

4. For course_c, one of the following conditions must be met:
   - If course_c is "CME 100" and has at least 5 units, your grade must be "B".
   - If course_c is "CME 102", "CME 104", or "CS 106B" and has at least 5 units, your grade must be "A-" or higher.
   - If course_c is "CME 106" and has at least 4 units, your grade must be "B+" or higher.
   - If course_c belongs to one of the following: "CS 145", "CS 147", "CS 148", "CS 155", "CS 173", "CS 221", "CS 223A", "CS 224N", "CS 224U", "CS 224W", "CS 227B", "CS 228", "CS 229", "CS 229M", "CS 231A", "CS 231N", "CS 234", "CS 236", "CS 237A", "CS 245", "CS 246", "CS 247", "CS 248", "CS 248A", "CS 251", "CS 255", "CS 273A", "CS 273B", "CS 279", "CS 345", "CS 347", "CS 348A", "CS 348B", "CS 348C", "CS 348E", "CS 348I", "CS 348K", "CS 355", "CS 356", "CS 373" with at least 3 units, then the course qualifies.

5. Additionally, your grade in any selected course must be one of the following: "A+", "A", "A-", "B+", "B", "B-", "C+", "C", "C-", "D+", "D", "D-", "F".

6. Each of the three courses (course_a, course_b, and course_c) must be distinct.

In summary, the selection criteria involve picking three distinct courses from specified lists, satisfying specific unit requirements and achieving acceptable grades within the defined ranges.
