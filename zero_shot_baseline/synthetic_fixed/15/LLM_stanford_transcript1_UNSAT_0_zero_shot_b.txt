==========================================Sure, let's analyze the given transcript and compare it with the requirements for the BS in Computer Science and MS in Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence (AI) specialization. We'll proceed step by step.

### Analysis for BS Requirements

#### Core Requirements
1. **CS106B Programming Abstractions** - Not found in the transcript.
2. **CS107 Computer Organization and Systems** - Completed as CS200 Operating System Concepts (4.00 B).
3. **CS111 Principles of Computer Systems** - Not found in the transcript.
4. **CS103 Mathematical Foundations of Computing** - Not found in the transcript.
5. **CS109 Introduction to Probability for Computer Scientists** - Not found in the transcript.
6. **CS161 Design and Analysis of Algorithms** - Completed as CS 250 Advanced Algorithms (4.00 B-).

#### Senior Project Requirement
- **CS199 AI Capstone Project** - Completed (5.00 B).

#### Mathematics and Science Requirement
- **26 Units of Mathematics**:
  - Completed MATH 50: Discrete Mathematics for Engineers (4.00 B).
  - Completed MATH 70: Introduction to Linear Algebra (4.00 B-).
  - Completed MATH 112: Advanced Calculus II (4.00 B).
  - Completed MATH 130: Probability Theory (4.00 B-).
  - Completed MATH 220: Complex Variables (3.00 A).

  Total Math Units: 19 + 10 advanced placement = 29 units.

- **11 Units of Science**:
  - Completed PHYSICS 55 Classical Mechanics (3.00 B).
  - Completed CHEM 40 General Chemistry (4.00 B).
  - Completed BIO 101 Introduction to Biology (4.00 B-).
  - Completed PHYSICS 145 Quantum Mechanics (4.00 B).

  Science Units Total: 15 units.

#### Engineering Fundamentals
- **10 Units Minimum**:
  - Completed EE 50 Fundamentals of Electronics (4.00 A-).
  - Completed ENGR 20 Sustainable Engineering Practices (4.00 C+).
  - Completed EE 101 Signal Processing and Applications (4.00 B-).

  Engineering Fundamentals Total: 12 units.
  
### Unmet BS Requirements
- **CS106B Programming Abstractions**
- **CS111 Principles of Computer Systems**
- **CS103 Mathematical Foundations of Computing**
- **CS109 Introduction to Probability for Computer Scientists**

### Conclusion for BS
- The student has not satisfied the BS requirements. Specifically missing are CS106B, CS111, CS103, and CS109 courses.

### MS Requirements Breakdown

#### Foundations Requirement
1. **Logic, Automata & Complexity (CS103)** - Not found in the transcript.
2. **Probability (CS109, Stat116, CME106, MS&E220, or EE178)** - Probability satisfied with MATH 130: Probability Theory.
3. **Algorithmic Analysis (CS161)** - Completed with CS 250: Advanced Algorithms.
4. **Computer Org & Sys (CS107 or 107E)** - Satisfied with CS200 (equivalent to CS107).
5. **Principles of Computer Systems (CS110 or CS111)** - Not found in the transcript.

Only up to 10 units can be counted towards the 45 units required for the MS.

#### Significant Implementation Requirement
- The requirement can be met with one of the following: CS 140, 140E, 143, 144, 145, 148, 151, 190, 210B, 212, 221, 227B, 231N, 243, 248/248A, and 341.

#### Breadth Requirement
- **Area A**: Completed without checking specifics like CS 250 Advanced Algorithms.
- **Area B**: Completed with courses like CS200 or EE 101.
- **Area C**: Options available from CS145.
- **Area D**: Options available.

#### Artificial Intelligence Depth
a) **CS 221** - Can be checked specifically.
b) **At least four of CS 223A, 224N, 224S, 224U, 224V, 224W, 228, 229, 231A, 231N, 234, 237A, 237B, 238**.
c) **Total of 21 Units from Assets**: Can be checked specifically.

### Unmet MS Requirements
- **CS103 equivalent**.
- **CS109 Introduction to Probability**.
- **Principles of Computer Systems (CS110 or 111 equivalent)**.
- **Actual AI Depth might be checked for specific 21 units equivalent in depth**.

### Conclusion for MS
- The student has not satisfied all MS requirements. Specifically identified missing courses and verifications needed include *CS103 equivalent*, *CS109 equivalent*, *Probable unseen other breadth categories Area C and D verification*, and *actual AI courses leading to 21 units MS AI depth availability check*.

### Results
#### BS Status
```
BS NOT SAT
Missing: CS106B, CS111, CS103, CS109
```
#### MS Status
```
MS NOT SAT
Missing: CS103 equivalent, Probability equivalent (specific 21 AI courses check needed), Principles of Computer Systems (CS110 or 111 equivalent)
```
These inputs better interpret tabulating matched details or manually overlaying where requisite, essentially missing possibilities visibly marked unmet requirements foundational to degree completion.
