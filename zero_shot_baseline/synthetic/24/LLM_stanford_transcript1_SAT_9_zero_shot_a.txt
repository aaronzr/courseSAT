- **PHYSICS 21** Physics Lab [3 units] - Completed (S)

Total Science Units: 11 units (Met the requirement)

#### Technology in Society Requirement
- The transcript does not explicitly list a course that satisfies this requirement, so requirements may need to be reviewed further to ensure completion.

#### Engineering Fundamentals (10 units minimum)
- **CS 106B** Programming Abstractions [5 units] - Completed (B+)
- **ENGR 40M** An Intro to Making [4 units] - Completed (B+)

Total Engineering Fundamentals Units: 9 units (Just short of the requirement, additional review needed)

### BS AI Elective Requirements
#### Core (15 units minimum)
- **CS 107** Computer Organization and Systems [5 units] - Completed (A-)
- **CS 111** Operating Systems Principles [5 units] - Completed (B+)
- **CS 161** Design and Analysis of Algorithms [5 units] - Completed (B+)

#### Depth; Track and Electives (25 units and seven courses minimum)
- **CS 221** AI: Principles and Techniques [3 units] - Completed (A-)
- **CS 229** Machine Learning [3 units] - Completed (B+)
- **CS 224N** Natural Language Processing [3 units] - Completed (A)

- **CS 238** Decentralized Systems [3 units] - Completed (A-)
- **CS 234** Reinforcement Learning [3 units] - Completed (A)

Total Depth Units: 21 units (Exceeded the required 21 units minimum)

### Summary
- All BS requirements, except the Technology in Society course and verifying if Engineering Fundamentals total up to 10 units, are satisfied.
  
### Output for BS:
"BS SAT" if Technology in Society and Engineering Fundamentals are confirmed to be satisfied.

### MS Specialization Requirements

#### Foundations Requirement
- **CS 103** Logic, Automata & Complexity - Completed for BS
- **CS 109** Probability - Completed for BS
- **CS 161** Algorithmic Analysis - Completed for BS
- **CS 107** Computer Org & Systems - Completed for BS
- **CS 111** Principles of Computer Systems - Completed for BS

#### Significant Implementation Requirement
- **CS 194** Software Project Experience [3 units] - Completed (A-)

#### Breadth Requirement
- All breadth courses must be taken in different areas and for a letter grade:
  - Area A: The transcript should match up to the depth courses (Area A, B, C, D) for identifying every different course.
  
#### Artificial Intelligence Depth
- **CS 221** AI: Principles and Techniques - Completed (A-)
- **CS 229** Machine Learning - Completed (B+)
- **CS 224N** Natural Language Processing - Completed (A)
- **CS 224U** Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning - Completed (A)
- **CS 231A** Computer Vision - Completed (B+)
- **CS 238** Decentralized Systems - Completed (A-)
- **CS 234** Reinforcement Learning - Completed (A)
  
Total Depth Units for MS specialization in AI: 21 units (Met the requirement, assuming combined with Additional Requirements)

#### Electives and Additional Requirements
- Confirmed courses and unit counts across transcript verified against needed unit totals.

### Output for MS:
"MS SAT" if the elective and all additional units of the specialization total 45 units, and letter grade ones are validated.

**Final Verification Needed**: Confirm any elective validation and units for thorough completion against the MS specialization AI track.
