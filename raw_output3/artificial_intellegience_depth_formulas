Sure, I will generate cvc5 Python solver formulas for the constraints extracted from the ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE DEPTH requirements:

1. All courses must be taken for a letter grade and for 3 or more units.
2. A maximum of 6 units of CS 399 Independent Study may be counted.
3. Any deviations must be noted and approved (maximum of one adviser-approved deviation allowed).
4. Courses already taken for Stanford undergraduate degree do not need to be repeated.
5. Specific courses to be taken from lists (a) and (b).
6. A total of at least 21 units from specified courses.

### Explanation:
1. **Course Units and Grades Constraints**: Ensure all courses have at least 3 units and a letter grade.
2. **CS 399 Constraint**: Limit the counted units of CS 399 to 6.
3. **Deviation Approval Constraint**: Ensure no more than one approved deviation.
4. **Specific Course Constraints**: Check if `CS 221` is taken or waived, and ensure at least four courses from list (b) are taken.
5. **Total Units Constraint**: Ensure at least 21 units are taken from the specified courses.

You'd also need to adjust the constraints and add corresponding logic to handle waivers, undergraduate course exclusions, and validate the derived constraints against the actual transcript data.
