FAQs






(a) A member or an associated person must have a reasonable basis to believe that a recommended transaction or investment strategy involving a security or securities is suitable for the customer, based on the information obtained through the reasonable diligence of the member or associated person to ascertain the customer's investment profile. A customer's investment profile includes, but is not limited to, the customer's age, other investments, financial situation and needs, tax status, investment objectives, investment experience, investment time horizon, liquidity needs, risk tolerance, and any other information the customer may disclose to the member or associated person in connection with such recommendation.
(b) A member or associated person fulfills the customer-specific suitability obligation for an institutional account, as defined in Rule 4512(c), if (1) the member or associated person has a reasonable basis to believe that the institutional customer is capable of evaluating investment risks independently, both in general and with regard to particular transactions and investment strategies involving a security or securities and (2) the institutional customer affirmatively indicates that it is exercising independent judgment in evaluating the member's or associated person's recommendations. Where an institutional customer has delegated decisionmaking authority to an agent, such as an investment adviser or a bank trust department, these factors shall be applied to the agent.
• • • Supplementary Material: --------------
.01 General Principles. Implicit in all member and associated person relationships with customers and others is the fundamental responsibility for fair dealing. Sales efforts must therefore be undertaken only on a basis that can be judged as being within the ethical standards of FINRA rules, with particular emphasis on the requirement to deal fairly with the public. The suitability rule is fundamental to fair dealing and is intended to promote ethical sales practices and high standards of professional conduct.
.02 Disclaimers. A member or associated person cannot disclaim any responsibilities under the suitability rule.
.03 Recommended Strategies. The phrase "investment strategy involving a security or securities" used in this Rule is to be interpreted broadly and would include, among other things, an explicit recommendation to hold a security or securities. However, the following communications are excluded from the coverage of Rule 2111 as long as they do not include (standing alone or in combination with other communications) a recommendation of a particular security or securities:
(a) General financial and investment information, including (i) basic investment concepts, such as risk and return, diversification, dollar cost averaging, compounded return, and tax deferred investment, (ii) historic differences in the return of asset classes (e.g., equities, bonds, or cash) based on standard market indices, (iii) effects of inflation, (iv) estimates of future retirement income needs, and (v) assessment of a customer's investment profile;
(b) Descriptive information about an employer-sponsored retirement or benefit plan, participation in the plan, the benefits of plan participation, and the investment options available under the plan;
(c) Asset allocation models that are (i) based on generally accepted investment theory, (ii) accompanied by disclosures of all material facts and assumptions that may affect a reasonable investor's assessment of the asset allocation model or any report generated by such model, and (iii) in compliance with Rule 2214 (Requirements for the Use of Investment Analysis Tools) if the asset allocation model is an "investment analysis tool" covered by Rule 2214; and
(d) Interactive investment materials that incorporate the above.
.04 Customer's Investment Profile. A member or associated person shall make a recommendation covered by this Rule only if, among other things, the member or associated person has sufficient information about the customer to have a reasonable basis to believe that the recommendation is suitable for that customer. The factors delineated in Rule 2111(a) regarding a customer's investment profile generally are relevant to a determination regarding whether a recommendation is suitable for a particular customer, although the level of importance of each factor may vary depending on the facts and circumstances of the particular case. A member or associated person shall use reasonable diligence to obtain and analyze all of the factors delineated in Rule 2111(a) unless the member or associated person has a reasonable basis to believe, documented with specificity, that one or more of the factors are not relevant components of a customer's investment profile in light of the facts and circumstances of the particular case.
.05 Components of Suitability Obligations. Rule 2111 is composed of three main obligations: reasonable-basis suitability, customer-specific suitability, and quantitative suitability.
(a) The reasonable-basis obligation requires a member or associated person to have a reasonable basis to believe, based on reasonable diligence, that the recommendation is suitable for at least some investors. In general, what constitutes reasonable diligence will vary depending on, among other things, the complexity of and risks associated with the security or investment strategy and the member's or associated person's familiarity with the security or investment strategy. A member's or associated person's reasonable diligence must provide the member or associated person with an understanding of the potential risks and rewards associated with the recommended security or strategy. The lack of such an understanding when recommending a security or strategy violates the suitability rule.
(b) The customer-specific obligation requires that a member or associated person have a reasonable basis to believe that the recommendation is suitable for a particular customer based on that customer's investment profile, as delineated in Rule 2111(a).
(c) Quantitative suitability requires a member or associated person to have a reasonable basis for believing that a series of recommended transactions, even if suitable when viewed in isolation, are not excessive and unsuitable for the customer when taken together in light of the customer's investment profile, as delineated in Rule 2111(a). No single test defines excessive activity, but factors such as the turnover rate, the cost-equity ratio, and the use of in-and-out trading in a customer's account may provide a basis for a finding that a member or associated person has violated the quantitative suitability obligation.
.06 Customer's Financial Ability. Rule 2111 prohibits a member or associated person from recommending a transaction or investment strategy involving a security or securities or the continuing purchase of a security or securities or use of an investment strategy involving a security or securities unless the member or associated person has a reasonable basis to believe that the customer has the financial ability to meet such a commitment.
.07 Institutional Investor Exemption. Rule 2111(b) provides an exemption to customer-specific suitability regarding institutional investors if the conditions delineated in that paragraph are satisfied. With respect to having to indicate affirmatively that it is exercising independent judgment in evaluating the member's or associated person's recommendations, an institutional customer may indicate that it is exercising independent judgment on a trade-by-trade basis, on an asset-class-by-asset-class basis, or in terms of all potential transactions for its account.
.08 Regulation Best Interest. This Rule shall not apply to recommendations subject to SEA Rule 15l-1 (“Regulation Best Interest”).

(a) A member or an associated person must have a reasonable basis to believe that a recommended transaction or investment strategy involving a security or securities is suitable for the customer, based on the information obtained through the reasonable diligence of the member or associated person to ascertain the customer's investment profile. A customer's investment profile includes, but is not limited to, the customer's age, other investments, financial situation and needs, tax status, investment objectives, investment experience, investment time horizon, liquidity needs, risk tolerance, and any other information the customer may disclose to the member or associated person in connection with such recommendation.

   - **Reasonable-Basis Suitability**: Understanding the potential risks and rewards associated with the recommended security or strategy.
   - **Customer-Specific Suitability**: The recommendation must be suitable for the individual customer based on their investment profile.
   - **Quantitative Suitability**: Ensuring that a series of recommended transactions are not excessive and unsuitable when taken together in light of the customer's investment profile.

### Constraints:
1. **Disclaimers**:
   - A member or associated person cannot disclaim any responsibilities under the suitability rule.

2. **Exclusions from Rule 2111**:
   - Communications that provide general financial and investment information, descriptive information about employer-sponsored retirement or benefit plans, asset allocation models (if compliant with Rule 2214), and interactive investment materials do not fall under Rule 2111, provided they do not include specific recommendations.

3. **Sufficient Information Requirement**:
   - Members or associated persons are required to use reasonable diligence to obtain and analyze factors relevant to the customer’s investment profile, even if some factors might be deemed non-relevant in specific circumstances.

4. **Financial Ability of Customer**:
   - A transaction or investment strategy cannot be recommended unless the member or associated person believes that the customer has the financial ability to meet such commitments.

5. **Institutional Investor Exemption**:
   - Exemption from customer-specific suitability is available for institutional investors under certain conditions, including the affirmation of exercising independent judgment.

6. **Regulation Best Interest**:
   - Rule 2111 does not apply to recommendations that are subject to SEA Rule 15l-1 ("Regulation Best Interest").

These extracted points summarize the main requirements and constraints associated with FINRA Rule 2111 on Suitability. 
        ===================generated formulas===========================
To generate cvc5 SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) formulas in line with the extracted constraints and requirements from "FINRA Rule 2111. Suitability", we need to represent each requirement and constraint as logical statements. Here is a mapping of those requirements and constraints into cvc5 SMT formulas:

### Requirements

(declare-const isSuitableForCustomer Bool)
(assert isSuitableForCustomer)
```

3. **Institutional Account Suitability**

```smt

(declare-const canEvaluateRisksIndependently Bool)
(declare-const indicatesIndependentJudgment Bool)

(assert (=> isInstitutionalAccount
           (and canEvaluateRisksIndependently indicatesIndependentJudgment)))
```

4. **Fair Dealing**

```smt
(declare-const meetsEthicalStandards Bool)
(assert meetsEthicalStandards)
```

5. **Obtaining Customer Information**

```smt

```

6. **Components of Suitability Obligations:**

   - **Reasonable-Basis Suitability**

   ```smt
   (declare-const understandsRisksRewards Bool)
   (assert understandsRisksRewards)
   ```

   - **Customer-Specific Suitability**

   ```smt
   (assert isSuitableForCustomer)
   ```

   - **Quantitative Suitability**

   ```smt
   (declare-const isNotExcessive Bool)
   (assert isNotExcessive)
   ```

### Constraints

1. **Disclaimers**

```smt
(declare-const hasNoDisclaimers Bool)
(assert hasNoDisclaimers)
```

2. **Exclusions from Rule 2111**

```smt
(declare-const isExcludedFrom2111 Bool)
(assert (not isExcludedFrom2111))
```

3. **Sufficient Information Requirement**

```smt
(declare-const usesReasonableDiligence Bool)
(assert usesReasonableDiligence)
```

4. **Financial Ability of Customer**

```smt
(declare-const customerHasFinancialAbility Bool)
(assert customerHasFinancialAbility)
```

5. **Institutional Investor Exemption**

```smt
(assert (=> isInstitutionalAccount indicatesIndependentJudgment))
```

6. **Regulation Best Interest**

```smt
(declare-const notSubjectToRegBestInterest Bool)
(assert notSubjectToRegBestInterest)
```

### Example Instantiation

Below is a full example bringing these constraints together in one cvc5 script. Note that some boolean constants are necessarily kept in the true range (like `hasReasonableBasis`, `meetsEthicalStandards`, etc.), to satisfy all specified requirements, while others should be customized based on real data inputs:

```smt
(set-logic QF_UF)

; Reasonable Basis for Recommendation
(declare-const hasReasonableBasis Bool)
(assert hasReasonableBasis)

; Customer-Specific Suitability Elements
(declare-const age Int)
(declare-const otherInvestments Bool)
(declare-const financialSituationNeeds Bool)
(declare-const taxStatus Bool)
(declare-const investmentObjectives Bool)
(declare-const investmentExperience Bool)
(declare-const investmentTimeHorizon Int)
(declare-const liquidityNeeds Bool)
(declare-const riskTolerance Bool)
(declare-const additionalInfo Bool)

; Customer-Specific Suitability Assertion
(declare-const isSuitableForCustomer Bool)
(assert isSuitableForCustomer)

; Institutional Account Suitability
(declare-const isInstitutionalAccount Bool)
(declare-const canEvaluateRisksIndependently Bool)
(declare-const indicatesIndependentJudgment Bool)
(assert (=> isInstitutionalAccount
           (and canEvaluateRisksIndependently indicatesIndependentJudgment)))

; Fair Dealing
(declare-const meetsEthicalStandards Bool)
(assert meetsEthicalStandards)

; Obtaining Customer Information
(declare-const hasSufficientInformation Bool)
(assert hasSufficientInformation)

; Reasonable-Basis Suitability - Understanding Risks and Rewards
(declare-const understandsRisksRewards Bool)
(assert understandsRisksRewards)

; Customer-Specific Suitability Assertion - Again for Emphasis
(assert isSuitableForCustomer)

; Quantitative Suitability - Not Excessive
(declare-const isNotExcessive Bool)
(assert isNotExcessive)

; No Disclaimers Allowed
(declare-const hasNoDisclaimers Bool)
(assert hasNoDisclaimers)

; Exclusions from Rule 2111 - False Indicating No Exclusion
(declare-const isExcludedFrom2111 Bool)
(assert (not isExcludedFrom2111))

; Sufficient Information Requirement
(declare-const usesReasonableDiligence Bool)
(assert usesReasonableDiligence)

; Financial Ability of Customer
(declare-const customerHasFinancialAbility Bool)
(assert customerHasFinancialAbility)

; Institutional Investor Exemption - Redundant with earlier assertion
(assert (=> isInstitutionalAccount indicatesIndependentJudgment))

; Regulation Best Interest Application
(declare-const notSubjectToRegBestInterest Bool)
(assert notSubjectToRegBestInterest)

(check-sat)
