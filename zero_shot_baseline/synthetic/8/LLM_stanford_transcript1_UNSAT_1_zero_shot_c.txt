==========================================Sure, let's start by evaluating whether Samantha Marie Franklin has satisfied the BS degree requirements for Computer Science at Stanford University. 

### BS Core Requirements:
1. **CS103 Mathematical Foundations of Computing**
2. **CS106B Programming Abstractions**
3. **CS107 Computer Organization and Systems**
4. **CS109 Introduction to Probability for Computer Scientists**
5. **CS111 Operating Systems Principles (formerly CS110)**
6. **CS161 Design and Analysis of Algorithms**

Based on the transcript, we see the following courses relevant to the BS core requirements:

- CS 101: Introduction to Computing
- CS 102: Data Structures
- CS 201: Algorithms 
- CS 202: Operating Systems 
- CS 301: Interactive Computer Graphics
- CS 303: Machine Learning
- CS 306: Artificial Intelligence
- CS 307: Natural Language Processing 
- CS 305: Database Systems 
- CS 402: Robotics

However, we also need to check if the specific core courses were taken:

1. **CS103**: Not found on transcript. 
2. **CS106B**: Not found on transcript. 
3. **CS107**: Not found on transcript.
4. **CS109**: Not found on transcript.
5. **CS111**: Could be equivalent to CS202, but explicitly taken CS111 is not noted.
6. **CS161**: CS 201 (Algorithms) may be equivalent but explicit course CS161 is not noted.

### BS Senior Project Requirements:
- A 2.0 GPA across courses including the senior project.
- Senior Project Course Options include CS194, CS194W, CS191, CS191W, CS210B, CS294.

No specific senior project courses (CS194, CS194W, etc.) are listed on Samantha’s transcript.

### BS AI Elective Requirements:
1. Core courses and depth requirements are mentioned, courses like CS221, and others but confirmation of these being taken is not present in the given transcript details.
2. Need to check Track Requirements A, B, C and electives are fulfilled. Courses like CS223A, CS224N, CS228, etc should be present in transcript.
3. Senior Project and additional units for elective completion must also be taken.

**Summary for BS Requirements:**
- **Missing Courses:**
    - CS 103: Mathematical Foundations of Computing
    - CS 106B: Programming Abstractions
    - CS 107: Computer Organization and Systems
    - CS 109: Introduction to Probability for Computer Scientists
    - CS 111: Operating Systems Principles
    - CS 161: Design and Analysis of Algorithms 
    - Senior Project course (CS194, CS194W, CS191, CS191W, CS210B, or CS294)

Since not all the required courses are explicitly listed in the transcript:
**Output:**
```
Courses not satisfied: CS103, CS106B, CS107, CS109, CS111, CS161, Senior Project course.
```

Now, evaluating the MS degree requirements:

### MS Foundations Requirement:
- **CS103**: Logic, Automata & Complexity
- **CS109**: Probability
- **CS161**: Algorithmic Analysis
- **CS107**: Computer Org & Sys
- **CS111**: Principles of Computer Systems

Assume foundational courses were covered in the BS degree (though explicitly not clear from above transcript, if advising or waiver was granted). Similar missing courses must be verified.

### MS Significant Implementation Requirement:
Students must undertake a specific designated significant implementation course which must additionally fulfill some other requirement. Examples include CS 140, 143, 145, etc.

### MS Breadth Requirement:
Three courses chosen from different areas A, B, C or D (specific coures not entirely clear from Samantha’s transcript).

### MS Artificial Intelligence Depth:
Need among:
- **CS221**: Required 
- Four other from listed CS courses such as (CS223A, 224N, 228, etc).

Evaluations of specific track courses also need to be checked.

### Additional MS Requirements:
- Minimum of 45 graduate units.
- MS electives, Breadth areas and ensuring units satisfy course number, letter grading and other constraints.

**Summary for MS Requirements:**
- Since Samantha's transcript does not fully confirm the specific required courses and the Artificial Intelligence track:
**Output:**
```
Courses not satisfied for MS degree based on provided data.
```

**Overall Summary:**
Given both BSc and MSc requirements checking:

**BS Missing Requirements:**
- Core specific CS courses (CS103, CS106B, CS107, CS109, CS111, CS161)
- BS Senior Project course

**MS Missing Requirements:**
- Detailed specifics for foundational, depth and breadth - Pending clear explicit course listings and specific adviser's approval.

**Final Output:**
```
BS Not fulfilled due to missing courses: CS103, CS106B, CS107, CS109, CS111, CS161 and Senior Project course.
MS UNSAT - Based on available data, specific requirement checks missing.
