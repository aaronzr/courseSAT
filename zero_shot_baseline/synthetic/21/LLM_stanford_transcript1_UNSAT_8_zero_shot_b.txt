==========================================To evaluate whether Amanda Johnson's transcript satisfies the BS and MS requirements for Computer Science at Stanford University, we'll use the degree requirements provided and compare them with the courses completed in her transcript. 

### BS Requirements

We'll break down into four main components:
- Core Requirements
- Senior Project Requirements
- AI Elective Requirements
- GPA Requirements

#### BS Core Requirements

1. **CS 103 (Mathematical Foundations of Computing):** Satisfied (Spring 2019, Grade: B+)
2. **CS 106B (Programming Abstractions):** Satisfied (Autumn 2019, Grade: C)
3. **CS 107 (Computer Organization and Systems):** Satisfied (Autumn 2020, Grade: C)
4. **CS 109 (Introduction to Probability for Computer Scientists):** Satisfied (Winter 2020, Grade: B+)
5. **CS 111 (Principles of Computer Systems):** Needs Course (No equivalent).
6. **CS 161 (Design and Analysis of Algorithms):** Needs to be Re-attempted (Autumn 2020, Grade: D)

#### BS Senior Project Requirements

Amanda needs at least one of the following:
1. **CS 191 or CS 191W:** Not taken (No equivalent)
2. **CS 194 or CS 194W:** Not taken (No equivalent)
3. **CS 210B:** Not taken (No equivalent)
4. **CS 294:** Not taken (No equivalent)
5. **CS 194H:** Not listed in the course options.

#### AI Elective Requirements
1. **Track Requirements A, B, C Drugs, Electives - 25 units minimum:** 
    - **CS221 (Prin. & Technique AI):** Needs Course (No equivalent)
    - **Track B (2 from areas):** Needs Courses (e.g., not all covered)
        - Amanda completed CS223A (Track B Robotics), CS222 (Track B NLP)
    - **Track C:** Needs Course (One additional from lists not fully covered)
        - This could be CS course from specified areas.
    - **Electives:** List any additional required electives.
- Need more specifics to detail units and track electives not explicitly listed in given requirements.

2. **Technology in Society Requirement (1 course):** Needs Course 
     (No equivalent).

3. **Engineering Fundamentals (CS106B, ENGR 40M or 76):** Satisfied (CS106B: Autumn 2019, Grade: C)

4. **Math and Science Requirements:**
    - Math 26 units:
        - MATH 19: Satisfied (5 units, Grade: B)
        - MATH 20: Satisfied (5 units, Grade: C)
        - MATH 21: Satisfied (5 units, Grade: B)
        - CS103: Satisfied (above)
        - CS109: Satisfied (above)
        - Plus 2 electives: (Not explicitly stated in given courses)
    - Science 11 units:
        - PHYS 41: Satisfied (Mechanics, Spring 2019, 4 units, Grade: A-)
        - PHYS 43: Not Explicitly Satisfied
        - Additional electives: (Physics/Chem classes needed)

### BS GPA Requirement
A 2.0 minimum GPA in major courses, calculated for combined ENGR Fundamentals, CS Core, Depth, and Senior Project courses:
   - CS Core GPA Calculation is complex: Need updated course grades, failed/incomplete might affect.
- Aggregate completion (senior project missing and other courses)

### Required Output (BS Requirements)
**Courses Not Satisfied:**
   - CS 161 (Design and Analysis of Algorithms) (Needs Re-attempt)
   - CS 111 (Principles of computer systems) (Needs Course)
   - Senior Project Courses (CS 191/W, 194/W, 194H)
   - PHYS 43 (Electricity and Magnetism)
   - Engineering Electives and TiS specific (Varies on courses)
   - Track Specifics from electives as per CS major 

### MS Requirements

#### MS Foundations Requirement
All foundation courses must be satisfied, including:
1. **CS103 - Logic, Automata & Complexity:** Satisfied (BS course)
2. **CS109, Stat116, CME106, MS&E220, or EE178 - Probability:** Satisfied (BS course)
3. **CS161 - Algorithmic Analysis:** Unsatisfied (Course completion needed)
4. **CS107 or 107E - Computer Organization & Systems:** Satisfied (BS course)
5. **CS110 or CS111 - Principles of Computer Systems:** Needs (Missing Courses)

#### MS Significant Implementation Requirement
One course from the specified implementation courses e.g., CS 140, 140E, 143:
- None listed in transcript.

#### MS Breadth Requirement
Complete three courses: Only one example:
  - Need broad depth from different CS areas (confirmed further detail)

#### MS Depth Requirement
21 depth units from AI depth:
1. **CS221:** Missing (Core AI Principles)
2. **AI electives:** Confirmed:
   - **CS223A:** (Robotics)
   - Others based on transcript AI depth pathway (tangible verification)
   - Balance missing in electives specifics (292A B)

#### MS Elective Requirement
Maximum account: All required electives, in final depth units:
   - Aggregate potential total 45 units (Calculating inclusive), ensuring non from undergraduate satisfy (possible repeats)

### Required Output (MS Requirements)
**Courses Not Satisfied**:
 - CS221 - AI Principles
 - Foundations Group (Combine depth, list verification)
 - Approved Electives + Calculated Implementation Requirement
 - Missing Specific MS AI Depth Track/Electives to satisfy minimum required units per course standards

Final:
* **BS NOT SATISFIED**
* **MS NOT SATISFIED**
