   - **Total:** 29 units 
2. **Science: 11 units minimum**
   - **PHYS 61 (5 units) + PHYS 63 (5 units) + PHYS 150 (4 units)**
   - **Total:** 14 units 

**Technology in Society Requirement:**
- Not clearly taken based on provided transcript, **missing**

**Engineering Fundamentals:**
- **CS 106A: Programming Methodology**: 5 units, Grade: B
- **EE 102: Introduction to Logic Design**: 3 units, Grade: B
- **Total:** 8 units, **short of 10 units minimum**

**Core, Depth, and Senior Project Combined:**
- **Minimum GPA 2.0:** 
  - CS Core GPA: Cannot be calculated exactly without knowing the weights, but considering the grades: (B- + D- + C + C+ ) /4 is close or slightly below 2.0.
  - Depth: CS 195 (B-), CS 134 (B+), CS 238(B), CS 140 (F), CS 150 (B+), CS 240 (C+), CS 233 (B).
  - Senior Project: CS 210B (C)

### Conclusion for BS:
Alicia Marie Jackson's BS degree is **NOT SATISFIED** because she is missing the following:
1. **CS Core Courses**: CS 103 and CS 109
2. **Technology in Society course**
3. **Engineering Fundamentals requirements** (short by 2 units)

### Master of Science (MS) Degree Requirements Analysis

#### Foundations Requirement:
1. **Logic, Automata & Complexity**: (CS103 or equivalent)
   - **CS103:** Not taken 
2. **Probability (CS109, Stat116, CME106, MS&E220, or EE178)** 
   - **Taken:** No equivalent, **missing**
3. **Algorithmic Analysis (CS161)**
   - **Taken:** Yes, Grade: C+
4. **Computer Organization & Sys (CS107 or 107E)**
   - **Taken:** Yes, Grade: D-
5. **Principles of Computer Systems (CS110 or CS111)**
   - **Taken:** CS111, Grade: C

**Significant Implementation Requirement:**
   - No clear completion based on transcript, **missing**

**Breadth Requirement:**
   - No clear completion based on transcript, **missing courses from all three breadth areas**

**Artificial Intelligence Depth:**
1. **CS 221: AI Principles & Techniques**
   - **Taken:** No, **missing**
2. **At least four from a list of specific AI courses**
   - Clearly missing based on transcript
3. **Total of at least 21 units from Depth categories: only few courses have been taken.**

**Electives:**
- Insufficient based on listed electives and requirements

### Conclusion for MS:
Alicia Marie Jackson's MS degree is **NOT SATISFIED** because she is missing the following:
1. **Foundations Requirement**: Missing CS 103 or equivalent, and Probability Requirement
2. **Significant Implementation Requirement**
3. **Breadth Requirement** 
4. **AI Depth courses and units from those courses**
5. **Completed units and electives as per MSCS requirements**

**Output:**
**BS NOT SATISFIED: Missing CS 103, CS 109, Technology in Society course, and fulfilling Engineering Fundamentals**

**MS NOT SATISFIED: Missing multiple foundation courses, breadth requirement, significant implementation, AI Depth courses, and elective units**
