We'll then translate each statement into corresponding CVC5 SMT formulas. In the end, we'll prepare a test case for the given test statement.

### Import the CVC5 library and initialize the solver
```python
import cvc5
from cvc5 import Kind

# Initialize the solver
solver = cvc5.Solver()
solver.setLogic("QF_UF")  # Quantifier-Free Uninterpreted Functions
```

### Define Uninterpreted Functions and Variables
```python
# Define sorts (custom types)
animal = solver.mkUninterpretedSort("Animal")
property = solver.mkUninterpretedSort("Property")

# Define functions
eats = solver.mkFuncDecl("eats", [animal, animal], solver.getBooleanSort())
chases = solver.mkFuncDecl("chases", [animal, animal], solver.getBooleanSort())
needs = solver.mkFuncDecl("needs", [animal, animal], solver.getBooleanSort())
is_prop = solver.mkFuncDecl("is_prop", [animal, property], solver.getBooleanSort())

# Define animals
bear = solver.mkConst(animal, "bear")
lion = solver.mkConst(animal, "lion")
mouse = solver.mkConst(animal, "mouse")
squirrel = solver.mkConst(animal, "squirrel")

# Define properties
round = solver.mkConst(property, "round")
blue = solver.mkConst(property, "blue")
kind = solver.mkConst(property, "kind")
red = solver.mkConst(property, "red")
```

### Translate each statement into formulas

```python
# If something eats the bear and the bear eats the lion then the lion is round
something = solver.mkVar(animal, "something")
stmt1 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, 
                      solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, eats(something, bear), eats(bear, lion)), 
                      is_prop(lion, round))

# If something chases the lion then the lion eats the squirrel
stmt2 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, chases(something, lion), eats(lion, squirrel))

# If something is red then it needs the lion
stmt3 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, is_prop(something, red), needs(something, lion))

# If something eats the squirrel and the squirrel eats the mouse then it chases the lion
stmt4 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, 
                      solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, eats(something, squirrel), eats(squirrel, mouse)), 
                      chases(something, lion))

# If the bear is blue and the bear needs the mouse then the mouse eats the lion
stmt5 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, 
                      solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, is_prop(bear, blue), needs(bear, mouse)), 
                      eats(mouse, lion))

# If something eats the lion and it is round then the lion is red
stmt6 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, 
                      solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, eats(something, lion), is_prop(something, round)), 
                      is_prop(lion, red))

# If something needs the lion then it eats the lion
stmt7 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, needs(something, lion), eats(something, lion))

# The bear chases the lion
stmt8 = chases(bear, lion)

# The bear chases the mouse
stmt9 = chases(bear, mouse)

# The bear is red
stmt10 = is_prop(bear, red)

# The bear is round
stmt11 = is_prop(bear, round)

# The bear needs the squirrel
stmt12 = needs(bear, squirrel)

# The lion eats the bear
stmt13 = eats(lion, bear)

# The lion is kind
stmt14 = is_prop(lion, kind)

# The lion needs the bear
stmt15 = needs(lion, bear)

# The mouse is round
stmt16 = is_prop(mouse, round)

# The squirrel chases the bear
stmt17 = chases(squirrel, bear)
```

### Add all formulas to the solver
```python
for stmt in [stmt1, stmt2, stmt3, stmt4, stmt5, stmt6, stmt7, stmt8, stmt9, stmt10, stmt11, 
             stmt12, stmt13, stmt14, stmt15, stmt16, stmt17]:
    solver.assertFormula(stmt)
```

### Test Statement: The bear eats the lion
```python
test_stmt = eats(bear, lion)

# Check if the test statement is satisfied
result = solver.checkSatAssuming(test_stmt)
if result.isSat():
    print("Satisfied")
else:
    print("Unsatisfied")
```

This code sets up the SMT solver, translates the contextual statements into formulas, and checks if "The bear eats the lion" is satisfied or not.
