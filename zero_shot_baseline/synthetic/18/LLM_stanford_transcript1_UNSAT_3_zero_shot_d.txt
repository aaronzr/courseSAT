```
The following courses are not satisfied:
- CS111: Operating Systems Principles
- CS161: Design and Analysis of Algorithms
- CS103: Mathematical Foundations of Computing
- CS221: AI: Principles and Techniques
- A few Track Requirement B and C courses
- Additional Math units to meet 26 units minimum
- Additional Science units to meet 11 units minimum
- Senior Project with CS191, 194, or 210B
```========================GPT Answer to Prompt Two Regarding MS Requirements====================
To determine whether the student Michael Alan Robson meets the MS in Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence Specialization) degree requirements, we'll analyze each aspect of his transcript against the stated MS requirements.

### FOUNDATIONS REQUIREMENT:
1. **Logic, Automata & Complexity (CS103)**
   - No course equivalent is mentioned in the transcript.
2. **Probability (CS109, Stat116, CME106, MS&E220, or EE178)**
   - CS 109 Intro to Probability: Grade B (satisfied).
3. **Algorithmic Analysis (CS161)**
   - No course equivalent is mentioned in the transcript.
4. **Computer Organization & Systems (CS107 or 107E)**
   - CS 107E Computer Systems: Grade B+ (satisfied).
5. **Principles of Computer Systems (CS110 or CS111)**
   - No course equivalent is mentioned in the transcript.

**Total Units Used to Satisfy Foundations Requirement:** At most 10 units.

**Conclusion:** The student has satisfied only 2 out of 5 foundation courses. Hence, courses CS103, CS161, and CS110/CS111 are missing.

### SIGNIFICANT IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENT:
- Courses that may be used to satisfy this requirement include: CS 140, 140E, 143, 144, 145, 148, 151, 190, 210B, 212, 221, 227B, 231N, 243, 248/248A, and 341.
- **CS 341 Machine Learning**: Grade A (satisfied).

### BREADTH REQUIREMENT:
- **Area A: Mathematical and Theoretical Foundations**
  - No course from this category is mentioned in the transcript.
- **Area B: Computer Systems**
  - No course from this category is mentioned in the transcript.
- **Area C: Applications**
  - No course from this category is mentioned in the transcript.
- **Area D: Computing and Society**
  - CS 181 AI: Ethics and Risks: Grade 'W' (Withdrawn, not satisfied).

**Conclusion:** The student has not satisfied the breadth requirements as there are no completed courses from Areas A, B, and C.

### ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE DEPTH:
- **a) CS 221**: Not mentioned in the transcript.
- **b) Need at least four courses from the stipulated list**:
  - Courses offered are CS 223A, 224N, 224S, 224U, 224V, 224W, 228, 229, 231A, 231N, 234, 237A, 237B, 238. 
  - CS 231N: Not mentioned in the transcript.
  - Only `CS 341 Machine Learning` from the list is satisfied.

### ELECTIVES:
Additional courses are required to reach the 45-unit requirement, considering units taken for breadth and depth.

### GPA REQUIREMENT:
- **Minimum GPA of 3.0 is required for the MS program:**
  - Graduate Career GPA: 3.389 (satisfied).

### SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTS NOT SATISFIED:
1. **Foundations Requirement:**
   - CS103 (Logic, Automata & Complexity).
   - CS161 (Algorithmic Analysis).
   - CS110/CS111 (Principles of Computer Systems).

2. **Breadth Requirement:**
   - Area A course.
   - Area B course.
   - Area C course.
   - Completion of any Area D course (CS 181 was withdrawn).

3. **Artificial Intelligence Depth:**
   - CS 221 course.
   - At least three additional courses from the stipulated AI depth list apart from CS 341.

### FINAL OUTPUT:
The courses not satisfied based on the student's transcript are:
- Foundations: CS103, CS161, CS110/CS111.
- Breadth: Area A, Area B, Area C, completion of Area D.
- AI Depth: CS 221, at least three more courses from the required depth list.

Therefore:
```
Foundations: CS103, CS161, CS110/CS111
Breadth: Area A, Area B, Area C, Area D
AI Depth: CS 221, three more courses from the provided list
```

**Conclusion:** MS requirements are **not satisfied**.
