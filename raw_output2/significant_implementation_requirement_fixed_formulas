        Please optimize your generated solver formulas by minimizing the use of
        for loops or if condition checks. The following example is an okay format, because we use a variable in the formula
        to parameterize the formulas as input to the solver: 
        ```python
        variable = solver.mkConst(solver.getStringSort(), "course")
        constraint_1 = [solver.mkTerm(Kind.EQUAL, solver.mkString(course.get("Course_ID")), solver.mkString(variable)) for course in transcript.get("Courses_Taken", [])]
        constraint_2 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.EQUAL, solver.mkString(variable), solver.mkString("CS 221"))
        formula = solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, constraint_1, constraint_2)
        ```
        The following example is NOT an okay format, because the formula is using hard coded values and is NOT parameterized: 
        ```python 
        for course in transcript.get("Courses_Taken", []):
                cs_221 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.EQUAL, solver.mkString(course.get("Course_ID")), solver.mkString("CS 221"))
        ```
        Please check the following out and convert for loops and if conditional checks into 
        solver formulas when possible: =======================prompt===========================

Explanation:
1. **Significant Implementation Course Requirement**: Ensures at least one course in the significant implementation list is taken.
2. **Course Taken for a Letter Grade**: Ensures the course is taken for a letter grade and is not graded as Pass/No Pass.
3. **Coterm Waiver**: Allows coterm students who have taken two of these courses at Stanford as undergraduates to waive this requirement.
4. **Deviations**: Ensures deviations are approved by the faculty director.

This structure uses parameterized solver terms and minimizes the use of explicit for loops and condition checks for more efficient constraint satisfaction checking.
