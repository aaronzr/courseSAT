Let's start by initializing the cvc5 solver and defining the necessary data types and variables:

```python
import cvc5
from cvc5 import Solver, Kind

solver = Solver()
solver.setLogic('QF_UF')

# Define sorts
Animal = solver.mkUninterpretedSort("Animal")
Property = solver.mkUninterpretedSort("Property")

# Define predicates
is_ = solver.mkPredicate(Animal, Property)
sees = solver.mkPredicate(Animal, Animal)
eats = solver.mkPredicate(Animal, Animal)
needs = solver.mkPredicate(Animal, Animal)

# Define constants for animals
bald_eagle = solver.mkConst(Animal, "bald_eagle")
mouse = solver.mkConst(Animal, "mouse")
squirrel = solver.mkConst(Animal, "squirrel")
tiger = solver.mkConst(Animal, "tiger")

# Define constants for properties
cold = solver.mkConst(Property, "cold")
round = solver.mkConst(Property, "round")
rough = solver.mkConst(Property, "rough")
```

Now let's translate each statement into cvc5 Python formulas:

1. **If something is cold and round then it sees the mouse.**

```python
x = solver.mkVar(Animal, "x")
premise = solver.mkAnd(is_(x, cold), is_(x, round))
conclusion = sees(x, mouse)
stmt1 = solver.mkForall([x], solver.mkImplies(premise, conclusion))
solver.assertFormula(stmt1)
```

2. **If something eats the squirrel and the squirrel sees the mouse then the mouse eats the bald eagle.**

```python
y = solver.mkVar(Animal, "y")
premise = solver.mkAnd(eats(y, squirrel), sees(squirrel, mouse))
conclusion = eats(mouse, bald_eagle)
stmt2 = solver.mkForall([y], solver.mkImplies(premise, conclusion))
solver.assertFormula(stmt2)
```

3. **If something eats the bald eagle then the bald eagle needs the tiger.**

```python
z = solver.mkVar(Animal, "z")
premise = eats(z, bald_eagle)
conclusion = needs(bald_eagle, tiger)
stmt3 = solver.mkForall([z], solver.mkImplies(premise, conclusion))
solver.assertFormula(stmt3)
```

4. **If something eats the bald eagle then it sees the bald eagle.**

```python
a = solver.mkVar(Animal, "a")
premise = eats(a, bald_eagle)
conclusion = sees(a, bald_eagle)
stmt4 = solver.mkForall([a], solver.mkImplies(premise, conclusion))
solver.assertFormula(stmt4)
```

5. **If something needs the tiger then it sees the mouse.**

```python
b = solver.mkVar(Animal, "b")
premise = needs(b, tiger)
conclusion = sees(b, mouse)
stmt5 = solver.mkForall([b], solver.mkImplies(premise, conclusion))
solver.assertFormula(stmt5)
```

6. **If the squirrel eats the mouse and the mouse eats the squirrel then the squirrel needs the tiger.**

```python
premise = solver.mkAnd(eats(squirrel, mouse), eats(mouse, squirrel))
conclusion = needs(squirrel, tiger)
stmt6 = solver.mkImplies(premise, conclusion)
solver.assertFormula(stmt6)
```

7. **If the squirrel sees the bald eagle and the squirrel eats the mouse then the squirrel is cold.**

```python
premise = solver.mkAnd(sees(squirrel, bald_eagle), eats(squirrel, mouse))
conclusion = is_(squirrel, cold)
stmt7 = solver.mkImplies(premise, conclusion)
solver.assertFormula(stmt7)
```

8. **The bald eagle eats the tiger.**

```python
stmt8 = eats(bald_eagle, tiger)
solver.assertFormula(stmt8)
```

9. **The bald eagle is rough.**

```python
stmt9 = is_(bald_eagle, rough)
solver.assertFormula(stmt9)
```

10. **The mouse eats the squirrel.**

```python
stmt10 = eats(mouse, squirrel)
solver.assertFormula(stmt10)
```

11. **The squirrel eats the mouse.**

```python
stmt11 = eats(squirrel, mouse)
solver.assertFormula(stmt11)
```

12. **The squirrel eats the tiger.**

```python
stmt12 = eats(squirrel, tiger)
solver.assertFormula(stmt12)
```

13. **The squirrel sees the tiger.**

```python
stmt13 = sees(squirrel, tiger)
solver.assertFormula(stmt13)
```

14. **The tiger is cold.**

```python
stmt14 = is_(tiger, cold)
solver.assertFormula(stmt14)
```

Now we will test the statement: **The squirrel does not eat the mouse.**

```python
test_stmt = solver.mkNot(eats(squirrel, mouse))

solver.checkSatAssuming(test_stmt)
result = solver.getSatResult()

print("The test statement 'The squirrel does not eat the mouse.' is:", result)
```

When you run this script, it will use the cvc5 solver to evaluate whether the given test statement is satisfied or unsatisfied based on the contextual statements provided.
