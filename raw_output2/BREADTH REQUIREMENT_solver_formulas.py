To generate CVC5 solver formulas based on the specified constraints for the Breadth Requirement in the DEPARTMENT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE MSCS Program Sheet (2022-23) Artificial Intelligence Specialization, we need to follow the constraints and check if the provided `course_choices` meet the requirements. Specifically, we need to ensure that:

1. Three courses from the Breadth Requirement are each chosen from a different Breadth area (A, B, C, or D).
2. Breadth courses must be taken for a minimum of 3 units each.
3. Breadth courses must be completed for a letter grade.

Here is the Python code that creates CVC5 solver formulas to validate these constraints:

```python
from cvc5 import Solver, Kind

# Initialize the CVC5 solver
solver = Solver()

# Defining courses and their respective units
course_list = [
    # Area A: Mathematical and Theoretical Foundations

# Create terms for each course
courses = {course: solver.mkBoolConst(str(course)) for area in course_list for course in area}

# Create terms for each course's units
units = {course: solver.mkIntConst(f"{course}_units") for area in course_list for course in area}

# Input from the user
course_choices = {
    cs154: (True, 3),
    cs140: (True, 3),
    history244f: (True, 3),
    cs348a: (True, 3)
}

# Assert user input choices
for course, (taken, unit) in course_choices.items():
    solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(Kind.EQUAL, courses[course], solver.mkBool(taken)))
    solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(Kind.EQUAL, units[course], solver.mkInteger(unit)))

# Breadth Requirement Constraints
# At least 3 courses, each from a different area
for area in course_list:
    solver.assertFormula(
        solver.mkTerm(
            Kind.OR, 
            *[
                solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, courses[course], solver.mkTerm(Kind.GEQ, units[course], solver.mkInteger(3)))
                for course in area
            ]
        )
    )

# At least one taken course per area must satisfy breadth requirement
solver.assertFormula(
    solver.mkTerm(
        Kind.AND, 
        *[
            solver.mkTerm(
                Kind.OR, *[courses[course] for course in area if str(course) in course_choices]
            )
            for area in course_list
        ]
    )
)

# Ensure each of the selected courses has at least 3 units and is taken for a grade (True)
for course in course_choices:
    solver.assertFormula(solver.mkTerm(Kind.GEQ, units[course], solver.mkInteger(3)))
    solver.assertFormula(courses[course])

# Checking if the solver can meet the constraints
is_sat = solver.checkSat()
print(f"Breadth Requirement Satisfied: {is_sat.isSat()}")
```

In this Python script:

1. We initialize the solver from `cvc5`.
2. Create boolean constants for each course and integer constants for each course's units.
3. Assert the user input (course choices) by setting the corresponding course boolean to `True` and assigning the units.
4. We ensure the Breadth Requirement constraints that a student must have taken at least three courses, each from a different Breadth area, and each course must be taken for a minimum of 3 units.
5. Check if the given `course_choices` meet the Breadth Requirements.

Please ensure you adjust course names and the user input dictionary according to your specific input and use the actual `cvc5` library.
