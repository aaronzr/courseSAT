        Your task is to generate cvc5 python solver formulas for the constraints in each requirement ELECTIVES

List here any additional courses used to complete the 45-unit requirement for the MSCS degree. You may count up to a maximum of 3 units of 1-2 unit seminars offered in the School of Engineering. All other electives must be taken for 3 or more units. CS courses numbered above 111, excluding CS196, CS198, and CS390A/B/C, can be used as MS electives. Non-CS courses must be technical courses numbered above 100, related to the degree program, and approved by the adviser and the MS program administrator. Note that CS 129 may not be counted towards the MS if CS 229 is being counted towards any BS or MS requirement.

        Your formulas should include every constrint, including the ones related to advisor approval and deviations.
        The formulas will check satisfiability of a given transcript schema template as input in the following format:

        When generating cvc5 solver formulas, please instantiate new variables to check the transcript schema against each constraint in the ELECTIVES. You should also include
        solver formulas for advisor approval and deviation constraints if there is one. Please generate
        formulas with respect to the requirements only. 
        =======================formula ouput===========================
Certainly! Here's how you can generate cvc5 formulas for each constraint in the ELECTIVES section:

1. **Count Up to a Maximum of 3 Units of 1-2 Unit Seminars offered in the School of Engineering.**
2. **All other electives must be taken for 3 or more units.**
3. **CS courses above 111, excluding CS196, CS198, and CS390A/B/C, can be used as MS electives.**
4. **Non-CS courses must be technical courses numbered above 100, related to the degree program, and approved by the adviser and the MS program administrator.**
5. **CS 129 may not be counted towards the MS if CS 229 is being counted towards any BS or MS requirement.**

This script generates necessary constraints to validate the transcript concerning the electives'. Each constraint is translated into a cvc5 formula, and the final conjunction of these constraints is checked for satisfiability. The `result` will tell you if the transcript meets all the requirements.
