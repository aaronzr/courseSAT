END OF TRANSCRIPT.
==================================================================GPT Answer to Prompt One Regarding BS Requirements====================
Based on the provided information, I will evaluate whether Emily Grace Johnson's transcript satisfies the Bachelor of Science (BS) in Computer Science requirements as specified. The BS requirements include completing core courses, senior projects, electives, math, science, engineering fundamentals, and a Technology in Society course. Let's go through each requirement step by step:

### Core Requirements
1. **CS 106B: Programming Abstractions** - Completed with a grade of B.
2. **CS 107: Computer Organization and Systems** - Completed with a grade of B.

1. **MATH 19: Calculus** - Completed with a grade of A.
2. **MATH 20: Calculus** - Completed with a grade of A-.
3. **MATH 21: Calculus** - Completed with a grade of A-.
4. **MATH 51: Linear Algebra** - Completed with a grade of A.
5. **CS 103: Mathematical Foundations of Computing** - Already listed above as part of the core requirements.
6. **CS 109: Introduction to Probability for Computer Scientists** - Already listed above as part of the core requirements.

Additional math electives:
- **ENGR 108: Introduction to Electromagnetics** - Completed with a grade of A.

### Science Requirement
1. **PHYS 41: Mechanics** - Completed with a grade of A.
2. **PHYS 43: Electricity and Magnetism** - Completed with a grade of A-.
3. Additional electives: **PHYS 45: Light and Heat** - Completed with a grade of B+.

### Engineering Fundamentals
1. **CS 106B: Programming Abstractions** - Already listed above as part of the core requirements.
2. **ENGR 40M: An Intro to Making: What is EE?** - Completed with a grade of A-.

### Technology in Society Requirement
- Not explicitly listed in the transcript, so this needs to be checked.

### Core, Depth, and Electives (AI Track)
1. **CS 107: Computer Organization and Systems** - Completed with a grade of B.
2. **CS 111: Operating Systems Principles** - Completed with a grade of B+.
3. **CS 161: Design and Analysis of Algorithms** - Completed with a grade of B+.
4. **CS 221: Artificial Intelligence: Principles and Techniques** - Completed with a grade of B.
5. Track Requirement B (two courses from different areas):
   - **CS 224N: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning** - Completed with a grade of A.
   - **CS 231A: Computer Vision: From 3D Reconstruction to Recognition** - Completed with a grade of A-.
6. Track Requirement C:
   - **CS 224W: Analysis of Networks** - Completed with a grade of A.
7. Additional Electives:
   - **CS 231N: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition** - Completed with a grade of B+.
   - **STAT 202: Data Mining and Analysis** - Completed with a grade of A-.
   - **CS 234: Reinforcement Learning** - Completed with a grade of A.
   - **CS 238: Decision Making Under Uncertainty** - Completed with a grade of A-.

### Summary and Conclusion
- Emily has successfully completed the **core courses** required.
- She has satisfied the **senior project requirement** by completing CS 194 and CS 210B.
- The **mathematics and science units** requirements are met.
- The **engineering fundamentals** requirements are met.
- **Technology in Society (TiS)** requirement is not explicitly stated in the transcript.

Since the TiS requirement is not explicitly satisfied, I need to list it:

`"Technology in Society (TiS) course from the approved list"`

Otherwise, everything else seems in order.

### Output
```
Technology in Society (TiS) course from the approved list
```========================GPT Answer to Prompt Two Regarding MS Requirements====================
To determine if Emily Grace Johnson satisfies the MSCS Artificial Intelligence Specialization requirements based on her transcript, we need to systematically evaluate each section of the requirements:

### 1. Foundations Requirement
- **CS 103 (Logic, Automata & Complexity):** Completed, B+
- **CS 109 (Probability):** Completed, B+
- **CS 161 (Algorithmic Analysis):** Completed, B+
- **CS 107 (Computer Organization & Systems):** Completed, B
- **CS 110 or CS 111 (Principles of Computer Systems):** Completed CS 111, B+

Emily has satisfied all the required foundation courses.

### 2. Significant Implementation Requirement
A course from the list needs to be marked as satisfying this requirement:
- **CS 210B (Project Experience with Corporate Partners):** Grade A, this course can be used to satisfy the Significant Implementation Requirement.

### 3. Breadth Requirement
Emily needs three courses from different Breadth areas (A, B, C, D):
- **Area A:** No course listed
- **Area B:** CS 210B, A (Computer Systems)
- **Area C:** CS 224N, A (Applications)
- **Area D:** ENGR 248, A (Computing and Society)

Emily has completed Breadth areas B, C, and D. However, she did not complete a course from Area A (Mathematical and Theoretical Foundations).

### 4. AI Depth Requirement
- **CS 221:** Completed, B
- Four additional AI courses:
  - **CS 224N:** Completed, A
  - **CS 224W:** Completed, A
  - **CS 231A:** Completed, A-
  - **CS 231N:** Completed, B+
  - **CS 234:** Completed, A

  At least 21 units from the combined list:
  - CS 221 (3 units)
  - CS 224N (3 units)
  - CS 224W (3 units)
  - CS 231A (4 units)
  - CS 231N (3 units)
  - CS 234 (4 units)
  - STAT 202 (3 units)
Total AI Depth units: 23 units

### 5. Electives
Electives are needed to reach the 45-unit requirement for the MSCS degree:
- **CS 238:** 3 units, A-
- **CS 229:** 3 units, A
- **CS 248:** 3 units, B+

Emily has completed additional units beyond the 21 units from the AI Depth requirement, and she has elective units.

### 6. Additional Requirements
- All courses numbered 100 or greater: Yes
- Max 10 units from Foundations: Yes, verified
- At most 3 units of 1-2 unit seminars: No seminars counted for MS units
- At least 36 units for letter grades: Yes
- Average grade at least B (3.0 GPA): Yes, GPA is 3.73
- Units previously applied towards BS not counted towards MS: Verified (no overlap)
- At least 45 graduate units at Stanford: Needs calculation from coursework

Using the listed and verified courses, we perform the final check:
1. Foundations: 10 units
2. Significant Implementation (also counting towards another requirement)
3. Breadth: Covered by CS 210B (B), CS 224N (A), and ENGR 248 (A)
4. Depth: Covered with AI courses and additional units (23 units total)
5. Electives: Completed with CS 238, CS 229, and CS 248.

### Conclusion
Emily has satisfied all requirements except the Breadth Area A. Thus, she does not yet satisfy all the degree requirements.

Final Output:
```
Courses not satisfied:
- Breadth Area A (Mathematical and Theoretical Foundations)
```
