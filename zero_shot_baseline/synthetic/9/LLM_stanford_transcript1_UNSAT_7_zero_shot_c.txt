First, let's analyze if John Alex Smith's transcript satisfies the BS in Computer Science degree requirements. 

### BS in Computer Science Requirements
#### Core Requirements:
1. **CS 106B: Programming Abstractions** - Taken and passed (B-).
2. **CS 107: Computer Organization and Systems** - Taken (CS 107E) and passed (B).
3. **CS 111: Operating Systems Principles** - Not taken.
4. **CS 103: Mathematical Foundations of Computing** - Not taken.
5. **CS 109: Introduction to Probability for Computer Scientists** - Not taken.
6. **CS 161: Design and Analysis of Algorithms** - Not taken.

#### Senior Project Requirements:
1. **CS 194 or CS 194W: Software Project Experience**, **CS 210B**, **CS 191 or CS 191W**, **CS 194H**, **CS294** - Not taken any senior project option from CS.

#### Required GPA:
Minimum 2.0 GPA for Engineering Fundamentals, CS Core, Depth, and Senior Project combined.

#### Additional Notes:
- The student has taken **CS 106A (Intro to Programming)**
- The student needs **specific CS courses** not taken.

Conclusion for BS requirements: **Not satisfied** due to missing specific core courses and the senior project requirement.

### Courses Not Satisfied For BS:
1. CS 111: Operating Systems Principles
2. CS 103: Mathematical Foundations of Computing
3. CS 109: Introduction to Probability for Computer Scientists
4. CS 161: Design and Analysis of Algorithms
5. Any CS Senior Project course (e.g., CS 194, CS 194W, CS 210B, CS 191, CS 191W, CS 194H, CS294)

Next, let's analyze if the transcript satisfies the MS Artificial Intelligence Specialization requirements.

### MS Artificial Intelligence Specialization Requirements

#### Foundations Requirement:
1. **CS 103** (Logic, Automata & Complexity) - Not taken.
2. **CS 109** (Probability) - Not taken.
3. **CS 161** (Algorithmic Analysis) - Not taken.
4. **CS 107** (Computer Organ & Sys) - Taken (CS 107E) and passed (B).
5. **CS 110 or CS 111** (Principles of Computer Systems) - Not taken.

#### Significant Implementation Requirement:
- The requirement should be addressed within any MS course but needs to be identified from taken courses.

#### Breadth Requirement:
- Minimum of three courses, each from a different area (A, B, C, D).
    - The transcript doesn't have any of the specified CS graduate-level Breadth Area courses.

#### Artificial Intelligence Depth:
- **a) CS 221** - Not taken.
- **b) At least four of specified AI courses** - None identified in the transcript.
- **c) A total of 21 units from categories (a) and (b), and additional specified courses** - None identified in the transcript.

#### Elective Requirements:
- Additional courses for the 45-unit requirement need to be specified from graduate-level coursework.

#### Additional Requirements:
- At most 10 units from Foundations requirement count towards 45 units.
- Minimum of 36 units must be taken for a letter grade.

Conclusion for MS requirements: **Not satisfied** as none of the specified AI depth courses, breadth requirement courses, or electives are identifiable from the transcript.

### Courses Not Satisfied For MS:
1. CS 103: Logic, Automata & Complexity
2. CS 109: Probability
3. CS 161: Algorithmic Analysis
4. CS 110 or CS 111: Principles of Computer Systems
5. Breadth Requirement courses from Area A, B, C, D.
6. CS 221 (AI: Principles and Techniques) and at least four additional AI Depth electives.
7. Significant implementation and elective courses to fulfill 45 total graduate units.

### Final Output:
Since both the BS and MS requirements are not satisfied, the respective outputs are:

- **BS** requirements analysis: Not satisfied with courses listed above.
- **MS** requirements analysis: Not satisfied with courses listed above.
