   - Must submit original documents, or certified copies from the issuing agency.
   - Applicants under age 18 must submit a civil birth certificate unless they provide a valid passport.
   - For dependents, additional documents to prove U.S. residency are required if the passport does not include a date of entry into the U.S.

   - School records are required for dependents under 18 and must be current as specified.

4. **Submission Methods:**
   - By Mail: Mail Form W-7 and required documents to IRS ITIN Operation.
   - By Private Delivery Services: Use specified address.
   - In-person: Visit designated IRS Taxpayer Assistance Centers (TACs).
   - Through an Acceptance Agent (AA) or Certifying Acceptance Agent (CAA).

5. **Telephone Help:**
   - 800-829-1040 (within the U.S.)
   - 267-941-1000 (outside the U.S., not toll-free).

### Constraints

1. **Form W-7 Usage:**
   - To apply for a new ITIN.
   - To renew an expired ITIN.
   - Not to be used if eligible for a Social Security Number (SSN).
   - Cannot be e-filed in the calendar year the ITIN is assigned.

2. **ITIN Specific Usage:**
   - Only required if included on a U.S. federal tax return.
   - Cannot be used to claim Earned Income Credit (EIC).
   - Children with ITINs cannot be claimed as qualifying children for EIC.
   - Cannot be used for Electing Small Business Trust (ESBT) elections unless otherwise required for tax filing.

3. **Renewal Applications:**
   - ITINs used solely on information returns for reporting purposes do not need immediate renewal.
   - An expired ITIN used in a federal tax return will cause a processing delay.

4. **Documentation Constraints:**
   - Must be original or certified copies.
   - Original documents will be returned within 60 days.
   - If original documents are needed within 60 days, apply in person at TAC or through a CAA.
   - Passports are the only stand-alone document unless dependent and do not include a date of entry into the U.S.
   - All foreign-language documents may require a certified translation if requested by the IRS.

To express the constraints in cvc5 SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories), we will define the appropriate sorts, variables, and assertions. Here are the SMT-LIB commands for the constraints identified in your tax application for ITIN:

This cvc5 SMT-LIB formula structure captures the constraints as directly as possible. Ensure that the relevant contexts from the original extract are correctly converted into these symbolic forms to convey their logical meaning effectively.
