Alright, let's translate each contextual statement into a CVC5 Python formula.

First, we'll load cvc5 and define the necessary variables and parameters for our problem. 

Here's how the process works:

1. Identify the predicates and constants.
2. Translate each statement into logical formulas.
3. Generate a test case for the given test statement.

Let's get started:

```python
import cvc5
from cvc5 import Kind

# Create an instance of the solver
solver = cvc5.Solver()

# Declare the sorts
Boolean = solver.getBooleanSort()

# Declare constants
charlie = solver.mkConst(Boolean, 'Charlie')
fiona = solver.mkConst(Boolean, 'Fiona')
gary = solver.mkConst(Boolean, 'Gary')
harry = solver.mkConst(Boolean, 'Harry')

# Declare predicates
cold = solver.mkPredicate(1, Boolean, 'cold')
furry = solver.mkPredicate(1, Boolean, 'furry')
rough = solver.mkPredicate(1, Boolean, 'rough')
young = solver.mkPredicate(1, Boolean, 'young')
white = solver.mkPredicate(1, Boolean, 'white')
smart = solver.mkPredicate(1, Boolean, 'smart')
quiet = solver.mkPredicate(1, Boolean, 'quiet')

# Define the contextual statements
statements = []

x = solver.mkVar(Boolean, 'x')

# 1. If something is cold and furry then it is rough.
statements.append(solver.mkExpr(Kind.IMPLIES,
                                solver.mkExpr(Kind.AND, cold(x), furry(x)),
                                rough(x)))

# 2. All furry things are young.
statements.append(solver.mkExpr(Kind.IMPLIES, furry(x), young(x)))

# 3. White, rough things are cold.
statements.append(solver.mkExpr(Kind.IMPLIES,
                                solver.mkExpr(Kind.AND, white(x), rough(x)),
                                cold(x)))

# 4. If something is rough and young then it is white.
statements.append(solver.mkExpr(Kind.IMPLIES,
                                solver.mkExpr(Kind.AND, rough(x), young(x)),
                                white(x)))

# 5. If something is smart and white then it is quiet.
statements.append(solver.mkExpr(Kind.IMPLIES,
                                solver.mkExpr(Kind.AND, smart(x), white(x)),
                                quiet(x)))

# 6. If something is rough and quiet then it is smart.
statements.append(solver.mkExpr(Kind.IMPLIES,
                                solver.mkExpr(Kind.AND, rough(x), quiet(x)),
                                smart(x)))

# 7. If something is young then it is cold.
statements.append(solver.mkExpr(Kind.IMPLIES, young(x), cold(x)))

# 8. If Harry is white then Harry is smart.
statements.append(solver.mkExpr(Kind.IMPLIES,
                                white(harry), smart(harry)))

# 9. If Harry is young then Harry is rough.
statements.append(solver.mkExpr(Kind.IMPLIES,
                                young(harry), rough(harry)))

# 10. Charlie is furry.
statements.append(furry(charlie))

# 11. Charlie is smart.
statements.append(smart(charlie))

# 12. Fiona is rough.
statements.append(rough(fiona))

# 13. Fiona is smart.
statements.append(smart(fiona))

# 14. Gary is smart.
statements.append(smart(gary))

# 15. Harry is quiet.
statements.append(quiet(harry))

# 16. Harry is smart.
statements.append(smart(harry))

# Add all the statements to the solver
for stmt in statements:
    solver.assertFormula(stmt)

# Define the test statement: Charlie is cold
test_statement = cold(charlie)

# Check satisfiability of the test statement
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkExpr(Kind.NOT, test_statement))
result = solver.checkSat()
print("Charlie is cold:", result == cvc5.Result.UNSAT)

# Check satisfiability directly for potential answer
solver.resetAssertions()
for stmt in statements:
    solver.assertFormula(stmt)

solver.assertFormula(test_statement)
result = solver.checkSat()
print("Charlie is cold:", result == cvc5.Result.SAT)
```

Key Points:
- We declared constants representing the entities: Charlie, Fiona, Gary, and Harry.
- Predicates represent properties: cold, furry, rough, young, white, smart, and quiet.
- Each contextual statement is translated into a corresponding formula using `mkExpr`.
- The test statement "Charlie is cold" is evaluated by the solver to determine its satisfiability.

Note: Ensure your system has the `cvc5` package installed and correctly configured Python environment to run the Python script.
