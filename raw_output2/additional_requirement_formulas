Certainly! Below is the cvc5 solver formulas for the constraints outlined in the additional requirements for the MSCS degree.

```

Note that I've made assumptions about the representation of specific constraints such as what makes a course a "foundations course" which will depend on how it's identified in the transcript, and assumed "CR" or "S" as grade values will satisfy MSCS requirements for specific time periods without breaking them out as separate variables. Adjustments may be needed based on the specifics of those identifications.
