For the task at hand, let's break down each statement and translate it into CVC5 SMT formulas in Python. First, we need to define the variables and predicates for each individual and their properties.

### Contextual Statements

1. **If someone is cold and quiet then they are white.**

    \[
    \forall x (\text{cold}(x) \land \text{quiet}(x) \rightarrow \text{white}(x))
    \]

2. **If someone is cold and big then they are young.**

    \[
    \forall x (\text{cold}(x) \land \text{big}(x) \rightarrow \text{young}(x))
    \]

3. **All furry people are white.**

    \[
    \forall x (\text{furry}(x) \rightarrow \text{white}(x))
    \]

4. **Quiet people are cold.**

    \[
    \forall x (\text{quiet}(x) \rightarrow \text{cold}(x))
    \]

5. **If someone is furry then they are white.**

    \[
    \forall x (\text{furry}(x) \rightarrow \text{white}(x))
    \]

6. **If someone is smart and white then they are furry.**

    \[
    \forall x (\text{smart}(x) \land \text{white}(x) \rightarrow \text{furry}(x))
    \]

7. **All furry people are big.**

    \[
    \forall x (\text{furry}(x) \rightarrow \text{big}(x))
    \]

8. **Charlie is cold.**

    \[
    \text{cold}(\text{Charlie})
    \]

9. **Charlie is furry.**

    \[
    \text{furry}(\text{Charlie})
    \]

10. **Charlie is smart.**

    \[
    \text{smart}(\text{Charlie})
    \]

11. **Dave is furry.**

    \[
    \text{furry}(\text{Dave})
    \]

12. **Dave is young.**

    \[
    \text{young}(\text{Dave})
    \]

13. **Gary is quiet.**

    \[
    \text{quiet}(\text{Gary})
    \]

14. **Gary is smart.**

    \[
    \text{smart}(\text{Gary})
    \]

15. **Harry is furry.**

    \[
    \text{furry}(\text{Harry})
    \]

16. **Harry is quiet.**

    \[
    \text{quiet}(\text{Harry})
    \]

17. **Harry is young.**

    \[
    \text{young}(\text{Harry})
    \]

### Test Statement

**Gary is furry.**

    \[
    \text{furry}(\text{Gary})
    \]

### CVC5 SMT Python Translation

Here is the translation of the above statements in Python using the CVC5 SMT solver:

```python
import cvc5
from cvc5 import Kind

# Create a solver instance
solver = cvc5.Solver()
solver.setLogic('QF_UF')

# Declare sorts
Person = solver.getUninterpretedSort("Person")

# Declare variables
Charlie = solver.mkConst(Person, "Charlie")
Dave = solver.mkConst(Person, "Dave")
Gary = solver.mkConst(Person, "Gary")
Harry = solver.mkConst(Person, "Harry")
x = solver.mkVar(Person, "x")

# Declare predicates
cold = solver.mkPredicate(Person, "cold")
quiet = solver.mkPredicate(Person, "quiet")
white = solver.mkPredicate(Person, "white")
big = solver.mkPredicate(Person, "big")
young = solver.mkPredicate(Person, "young")
furry = solver.mkPredicate(Person, "furry")
smart = solver.mkPredicate(Person, "smart")

# Define contextual statements
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkForall([x], solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, cold(x), quiet(x)), white(x))))  # If cold and quiet then white
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkForall([x], solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, cold(x), big(x)), young(x))))   # If cold and big then young
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkForall([x], solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, furry(x), white(x))))                                 # All furry people are white
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkForall([x], solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, quiet(x), cold(x))))                                  # Quiet people are cold
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkForall([x], solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, furry(x), white(x))))                                 # If furry then white
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkForall([x], solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, smart(x), white(x)), furry(x))))  # If smart and white then furry
solver.assertFormula(solver.mkForall([x], solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, furry(x), big(x))))                                   # All furry people are big

# Define specific individuals
solver.assertFormula(cold(Charlie))   # Charlie is cold
solver.assertFormula(furry(Charlie))  # Charlie is furry
solver.assertFormula(smart(Charlie))  # Charlie is smart
solver.assertFormula(furry(Dave))     # Dave is furry
solver.assertFormula(young(Dave))     # Dave is young
solver.assertFormula(quiet(Gary))     # Gary is quiet
solver.assertFormula(smart(Gary))     # Gary is smart
solver.assertFormula(furry(Harry))    # Harry is furry
solver.assertFormula(quiet(Harry))    # Harry is quiet
solver.assertFormula(young(Harry))    # Harry is young

# Test statement (Gary is furry)
test_statement = furry(Gary)

# Check the satisfiability of the test statement
solver.push()
solver.assertFormula(test_statement)
result = solver.checkSat()
solver.pop()

print("Is the test statement 'Gary is furry' satisfied?", result)
```

This code builds the logic structure based on the contextual statements and then checks whether the test statement "Gary is furry" is satisfied given those contexts.
