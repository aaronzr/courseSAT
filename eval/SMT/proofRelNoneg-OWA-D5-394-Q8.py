I will use the CVC5 Python API for these transformations.

First, let's load the necessary libraries and define the variables to be used in our formulas.

```python
import cvc5
from cvc5 import Kind

# Initialize solver
solver = cvc5.Solver()

# Create boolean sort
bool_sort = solver.getBooleanSort()

# Define the entities
entities = ['someone', 'bald_eagle', 'bear', 'cow', 'squirrel']

# Create variables for each predicate
predicates = {}
for entity in entities:
    predicates[entity] = {
        'is_young': solver.mkConst(bool_sort, f'{entity}_is_young'),
        'is_rough': solver.mkConst(bool_sort, f'{entity}_is_rough'),
        'is_cold': solver.mkConst(bool_sort, f'{entity}_is_cold'),
        'is_blue': solver.mkConst(bool_sort, f'{entity}_is_blue'),
        'chases': {target: solver.mkConst(bool_sort, f'{entity}_chases_{target}') for target in entities},
        'likes': {target: solver.mkConst(bool_sort, f'{entity}_likes_{target}') for target in entities},
        'visits': {target: solver.mkConst(bool_sort, f'{entity}_visits_{target}') for target in entities}
    }
```

Next, we translate each statement into CVC5 SMT-LIB python formulas:

```python
# 1. If someone chases the squirrel then they like the squirrel.
stmt1 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, predicates['someone']['chases']['squirrel'], predicates['someone']['likes']['squirrel'])

# 2. If someone is young and rough then they chase the squirrel.
is_young_and_rough = solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, predicates['someone']['is_young'], predicates['someone']['is_rough'])
stmt2 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, is_young_and_rough, predicates['someone']['chases']['squirrel'])

# 3. If someone likes the bear then they visit the bald eagle.
stmt3 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, predicates['someone']['likes']['bear'], predicates['someone']['visits']['bald_eagle'])

# 4. If someone is cold then they chase the bald eagle.
stmt4 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, predicates['someone']['is_cold'], predicates['someone']['chases']['bald_eagle'])

# 5. If someone likes the cow then they are blue.
stmt5 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, predicates['someone']['likes']['cow'], predicates['someone']['is_blue'])

# 6. If someone visits the bald eagle and they like the squirrel then they like the bear.
visits_and_likes_squirrel = solver.mkTerm(Kind.AND, predicates['someone']['visits']['bald_eagle'], predicates['someone']['likes']['squirrel'])
stmt6 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, visits_and_likes_squirrel, predicates['someone']['likes']['bear'])

# 7. If someone is cold then they visit the bear.
stmt7 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, predicates['someone']['is_cold'], predicates['someone']['visits']['bear'])

# 8. If someone chases the bald eagle then they are young.
stmt8 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, predicates['someone']['chases']['bald_eagle'], predicates['someone']['is_young'])

# 9. If someone is young then they chase the squirrel.
stmt9 = solver.mkTerm(Kind.IMPLIES, predicates['someone']['is_young'], predicates['someone']['chases']['squirrel'])

# 10. The bald eagle likes the cow.
stmt10 = predicates['bald_eagle']['likes']['cow']

# 11. The bald eagle visits the cow.
stmt11 = predicates['bald_eagle']['visits']['cow']

# 12. The bear chases the bald eagle.
stmt12 = predicates['bear']['chases']['bald_eagle']

# 13. The bear is rough.
stmt13 = predicates['bear']['is_rough']

# 14. The cow is cold.
stmt14 = predicates['cow']['is_cold']

# 15. The cow likes the bald eagle.
stmt15 = predicates['cow']['likes']['bald_eagle']

# 16. The cow visits the bald eagle.
stmt16 = predicates['cow']['visits']['bald_eagle']

# 17. The squirrel is young.
stmt17 = predicates['squirrel']['is_young']

# 18. The squirrel likes the bear.
stmt18 = predicates['squirrel']['likes']['bear']

# 19. The squirrel visits the cow.
stmt19 = predicates['squirrel']['visits']['cow']

# Test case: The cow does not chase the squirrel.
test_stmt = solver.mkTerm(Kind.NOT, predicates['cow']['chases']['squirrel'])
```

Finally, we create the solver to evaluate all these statements including the test statement:

```python
# Add all statements to the solver
solver.assertFormula(stmt1)
solver.assertFormula(stmt2)
solver.assertFormula(stmt3)
solver.assertFormula(stmt4)
solver.assertFormula(stmt5)
solver.assertFormula(stmt6)
solver.assertFormula(stmt7)
solver.assertFormula(stmt8)
solver.assertFormula(stmt9)
solver.assertFormula(stmt10)
solver.assertFormula(stmt11)
solver.assertFormula(stmt12)
solver.assertFormula(stmt13)
solver.assertFormula(stmt14)
solver.assertFormula(stmt15)
solver.assertFormula(stmt16)
solver.assertFormula(stmt17)
solver.assertFormula(stmt18)
solver.assertFormula(stmt19)

# Assert the test statement
solver.assertFormula(test_stmt)

# Check satisfiability
result = solver.checkSat()
```

You can then evaluate the result:

```python
print(f'The test statement "The cow does not chase the squirrel." is: {result}')
```

Save this script as a Python file and run it to evaluate the test statement. This approach uses CVC5 bindings in Python and asserts all the given contextual statements and tests the satisfiability of the given test statement.
