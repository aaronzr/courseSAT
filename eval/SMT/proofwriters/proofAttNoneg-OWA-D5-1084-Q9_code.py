To translate the given contextual statements and the test statement into CVC5 python formulas, we need to define the properties and individuals and then express the logical relationships using formulas. Let's proceed step-by-step:

### Setting Up the Environment

We will start by importing the required components from CVC5:

```python
from cvc5 import Solver, Term
from cvc5.lib.expr import Not, And, Or, Implies, Equals, Forall
```

### Defining Properties and Individuals

First, we need to define the individuals and their properties:

```python
solver = Solver()

# Define sorts (types)
People = solver.getBooleanSort()

# Define individuals
Charlie = solver.mkConst(People, 'Charlie')
Dave = solver.mkConst(People, 'Dave')
Fiona = solver.mkConst(People, 'Fiona')
Harry = solver.mkConst(People, 'Harry')

# Define predicates for properties
red = solver.mkUnaryTerm(People)
white = solver.mkUnaryTerm(People)
green = solver.mkUnaryTerm(People)
round_property = solver.mkUnaryTerm(People)
furry = solver.mkUnaryTerm(People)
blue = solver.mkUnaryTerm(People)
young = solver.mkUnaryTerm(People)
```

### Translating Contextual Statements

Now, let's translate each statement into CVC5 python formulas:

1. **If someone is red then they are round:**
   ```python
   solver.assertFormula(Forall([People], Implies(red(People), round_property(People))))
   ```

2. **If someone is white then they are furry:**
   ```python
   solver.assertFormula(Forall([People], Implies(white(People), furry(People))))
   ```

3. **If someone is green and round then they are blue:**
   ```python
   solver.assertFormula(Forall([People], Implies(And(green(People), round_property(People)), blue(People))))
   ```

4. **All round people are green:**
   ```python
   solver.assertFormula(Forall([People], Implies(round_property(People), green(People))))
   ```

5. **All furry, red people are round:**
   ```python
   solver.assertFormula(Forall([People], Implies(And(furry(People), red(People)), round_property(People))))
   ```

6. **Furry people are blue:**
   ```python
   solver.assertFormula(Forall([People], Implies(furry(People), blue(People))))
   ```

7. **If Dave is round and Dave is young then Dave is green:**
   ```python
   solver.assertFormula(Implies(And(round_property(Dave), young(Dave)), green(Dave)))
   ```

8. **If Dave is round then Dave is green:**
   ```python
   solver.assertFormula(Implies(round_property(Dave), green(Dave)))
   ```

9. **If someone is blue then they are white:**
   ```python
   solver.assertFormula(Forall([People], Implies(blue(People), white(People))))
   ```

10. **Charlie is furry:**
    ```python
    solver.assertFormula(furry(Charlie))
    ```

11. **Charlie is green:**
    ```python
    solver.assertFormula(green(Charlie))
    ```

12. **Charlie is white:**
    ```python
    solver.assertFormula(white(Charlie))
    ```

13. **Dave is round:**
    ```python
    solver.assertFormula(round_property(Dave))
    ```

14. **Dave is young:**
    ```python
    solver.assertFormula(young(Dave))
    ```

15. **Fiona is red:**
    ```python
    solver.assertFormula(red(Fiona))
    ```

16. **Harry is furry:**
    ```python
    solver.assertFormula(furry(Harry))
    ```

17. **Harry is green:**
    ```python
    solver.assertFormula(green(Harry))
    ```

18. **Harry is round:**
    ```python
    solver.assertFormula(round_property(Harry))
    ```

19. **Harry is young:**
    ```python
    solver.assertFormula(young(Harry))
    ```

### Test Statement

We need to check if "Fiona is white":

```python
test_formula = white(Fiona)
```

### Solving

Let's evaluate the test formula using the solver:

```python
solver.assertFormula(Not(test_formula))
result = solver.checkSat()

if result.isUnsat():
    print("Fiona is white: SATISFIED")
else:
    print("Fiona is white: UNSATISFIED")
```

### Complete Code
Here's the complete code snippet:

```python
from cvc5 import Solver, Term
from cvc5.lib.expr import Not, And, Or, Implies, Equals, Forall

solver = Solver()

# Define sorts (types)
People = solver.getBooleanSort()

# Define individuals
Charlie = solver.mkConst(People, 'Charlie')
Dave = solver.mkConst(People, 'Dave')
Fiona = solver.mkConst(People, 'Fiona')
Harry = solver.mkConst(People, 'Harry')

# Define predicates for properties
red = solver.mkUnaryTerm(People)
white = solver.mkUnaryTerm(People)
green = solver.mkUnaryTerm(People)
round_property = solver.mkUnaryTerm(People)
furry = solver.mkUnaryTerm(People)
blue = solver.mkUnaryTerm(People)
young = solver.mkUnaryTerm(People)

# Adding contextual statements to the solver
solver.assertFormula(Forall([People], Implies(red(People), round_property(People))))
solver.assertFormula(Forall([People], Implies(white(People), furry(People))))
solver.assertFormula(Forall([People], Implies(And(green(People), round_property(People)), blue(People))))
solver.assertFormula(Forall([People], Implies(round_property(People), green(People))))
solver.assertFormula(Forall([People], Implies(And(furry(People), red(People)), round_property(People))))
solver.assertFormula(Forall([People], Implies(furry(People), blue(People))))
solver.assertFormula(Implies(And(round_property(Dave), young(Dave)), green(Dave)))
solver.assertFormula(Implies(round_property(Dave), green(Dave)))
solver.assertFormula(Forall([People], Implies(blue(People), white(People))))
solver.assertFormula(furry(Charlie))
solver.assertFormula(green(Charlie))
solver.assertFormula(white(Charlie))
solver.assertFormula(round_property(Dave))
solver.assertFormula(young(Dave))
solver.assertFormula(red(Fiona))
solver.assertFormula(furry(Harry))
solver.assertFormula(green(Harry))
solver.assertFormula(round_property(Harry))
solver.assertFormula(young(Harry))

# Test statement: Fiona is white
test_formula = white(Fiona)

solver.assertFormula(Not(test_formula))
result = solver.checkSat()

if result.isUnsat():
    print("Fiona is white: SATISFIED")
else:
    print("Fiona is white: UNSATISFIED")
```

This code will evaluate whether "Fiona is white" given the provided contextual statements.
