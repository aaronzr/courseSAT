**Output: BS SAT**========================GPT Answer to Prompt Two Regarding MS Requirements====================
To determine if Jeremy Lee Bregman satisfies the MS in Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence Specialization requirements, we need to evaluate his transcript against the following criteria:

### Foundation Requirement:
1. **Logic, Automata & Complexity:**
   - CS 103 (Mathematical Foundations of Computing) 
   - **Grade:** A-

2. **Probability:**
   - CS 109 (Introduction to Probability for Computer Scientists)
   - **Grade:** B+
   
3. **Algorithmic Analysis:**
   - CS 161 (Design and Analysis of Algorithms)
   - **Grade:** A-
   
4. **Computer Organization & Systems:**
   - CS 107 (Computer Organization and Systems)
   - **Grade:** B+

5. **Principles of Computer Systems:**
   - CS 110 OR CS 111
   - He completed CS 111 (Operating Systems Principles)
   - **Grade:** A
   
   **Total Units for Foundations:** 21 units
   
### Significant Implementation Requirement:
- Jeremy completed CS 140E (Embedded Operating Systems)
- **Grade:** A+
- **Course:** CS 140E is on the approved list.

### Breadth Requirement:
Jeremy needs three courses from different Breadth Areas (A, B, C, D):

1. **Area A:** Mathematical and Theoretical Foundations
   - CS 157 (Computational Logic)
   - **Grade:** A

2. **Area B:** Computer Systems
   - CS 140E (Embedded Operating Systems)
   - **Grade:** A+
   
3. **Area C:** Applications
   - CS 224R (Deep Reinforcement Learning)
   - **Grade:** B

### AI Depth Requirement:
Courses from categories (a), (b), and additional listed courses must total at least 21 units.
   
1. **CS 221 (AI: Principles and Techniques):**
   - **Grade:** B+
   - **Units:** 4

2. **Additional Depth Courses:**
   - CS 224R (Deep Reinforcement Learning)
     - **Units:** 5
     - **Grade:** B
   - CS 226 (Topics in Advanced Robotic Manipulation)
     - **Units:** 4
     - **Grade:** A-
   - CS 329D (ML Under Distribution Shifts)
     - **Units:** 5
     - **Grade:** A
   - CS 325B (Data for Sustainable Development)
     - **Units:** 5
     - **Grade:** A-

**Total Depth Units:** 23 units

### Electives:
- His coursework includes additional courses beyond the foundational and depth requirements.

### Additional Requirements:
- All courses for the MSCS degree must be numbered 100 or greater -> Jeremy's courses satisfy this.
- At most 10 units of Foundations can count towards 45 units total -> Jeremy has 21 units of foundational courses listed but only needs to count 10 units.
- GPA minimum is 3.0 -> Jeremy's GPA is well above this.
- Total graduate units should be at least 45; prior to any "semester with 0.00 credits," ensure there are no inconsistencies; though that aspect isn't fully covered.
   
Jeremy has met all the requirements as outlined (with the one noted check on any disqualification that may arise from 0.00 credit with "Term Totals 10.00 0.00" occurring at Spring 2014-2015). Pending clarification or update from the last detailing progress, all specifics otherwise align correctly:

Thus:

**Output:** "MS SAT"
