   - **CS 329D:** ML Under Distribution Shifts ✓

Total Depth and Elective Units:
   15 units (for core) + 28 units (for depth and electives) = 43 units ✓ (Meets minimum requirement)

### Conclusion
All degree requirements for BS in Computer Science at Stanford University are satisfied based on the given transcript.

**Output: "BS SAT"**========================GPT Answer to Prompt Two Regarding MS Requirements====================
To determine whether Jeremy Lee Bregman satisfies the MS in Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence Specialization) requirements, we need to cross-reference the courses on his transcript with the requirements specified.

### Step-by-step Analysis:

#### 1. Foundations Requirement:
- **Logic, Automata & Complexity:** 
  - CS 103 MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATIONS OF COMPUTING → A-
- **Probability:**
  - MS&E 220 PROBABILISTIC ANALYSIS → A- 
  - CS 109 INTRODUCTION TO PROBABILITY FOR COMPUTER SCIENTISTS → B+
- **Algorithmic Analysis:**
  - CS 161 DESIGN AND ANALYSIS OF ALGORITHMS → A-
- **Computer Org & Sys:**
  - CS 107 COMPUTER ORGANIZATION AND SYSTEMS → B+
- **Principles of Computer Systems:**
  - CS 110 PRINCIPLES OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS → A

All required foundations have been satisfied.

#### 2. Significant Implementation Requirement:
Courses that may satisfy this include CS 140E, which was taken with an A+:

- **CS 140E EMBEDDED OPERATING SYSTEM → A+** (satisfies depth requirement as well)

#### 3. Breadth Requirement (Three courses, each from a different area A, B, C, or D):

- **Area A. Mathematical and Theoretical Foundations:**
  - CS 154 INTRODUCTION TO AUTOMATA AND COMPLEXITY THEORY → A
- **Area B. Computer Systems:**
  - CS 140E EMBEDDED OPERATING SYSTEM → A+
- **Area C. Applications:**
  - CS 223A INTRODUCTION TO ROBOTICS → A

All three areas have at least one course taken for a letter grade, and each is from a different area.

#### 4. Artificial Intelligence Depth (At least 21 units from depth courses):

- **CS 221 AI: PRINCIPLES AND TECHNIQUES → B+ (4 units)**
- **CS 224N NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING WITH DEEP LEARNING → A (5 units)**
- **CS 223A INTRODUCTION TO ROBOTICS → A (4 units)**
- **CS 238 DECISION MAKING UNDER UNCERTAINTY → A (5 units)**
- **CS 229 MACHINE LEARNING → A (4 units)**
- **CS 231A COMPUTER VISION → A (5 units)**
- **CS 205L Continuous Mathematical Methods with an Emphasis on Machine Learning → A (5 units)**

Total units for AI depth courses = 32 units, well over the required 21 units.

#### 5. Electives 

Any additional courses to complete the 45-unit requirement:

- **CS 345 TOPICS IN DATA WAREHOUSING → A (5 units)** (valid elective as it’s a CS course numbered above 111)
- The total units from the listed MS CS courses already exceed 45 units, making up excess elective requirements.

#### 6. Additional MS Requirements:
- A maximum of 10 units of Foundations requirement courses count towards 45 units.
- A maximum of 3 units of 1-2 unit seminars count towards 45 units.
- At least 36 units must be taken for a letter grade.
- Average grade at least B (3.0 GPA).
- Courses previously applied towards BS cannot be counted for MS.

The transcript indicates high performance with a cumulative GPA above 3.0 and enough total units. All courses (36+ units) are satisfactory for a letter grade.

### Conclusion:
Jeremy Lee Bregman satisfies all listed requirements for the MS in Computer Science with an Artificial Intelligence specialization at Stanford University.

**Output:**
```
MS SAT
