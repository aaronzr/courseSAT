2. **Science Requirements (11 units minimum)**
   - PHYS 41, PHYS 43, One elective
   
3. **Technology in Society**
   - One course from an approved list
   
4. **Engineering Fundamentals (10 units minimum)**

6. **Depth Requirements (AI Track, 25 units minimum)**
   - CS 221
   - Two Track B courses (AI Methods, NLP, Vision, Robotics)
   - Track C course
   - Three electives
   
7. **Senior Project (at least 3 units)**

### Transcript Analysis for BS Core Requirements
- **Math Requirements: Satisfied**
  - AP Calculus AB (10 units)
  - MATH 50 (Discrete Mathematics for Engineers), MATH 70 (Linear Algebra), MATH 112 (Advanced Calculus II), MATH 130 (Probability Theory)
  
- **Science Requirements: Partially Satisfied**
  - PHYSICS 55 (Classical Mechanics)
  - PHYSICS 145 (Quantum Mechanics)
  - CHEM 40 (General Chemistry)
  - Needs PHYS 43 or equivalent
  
- **Technology in Society: Not Satisfied**
  - No course listed from Technology in Society
   
- **Engineering Fundamentals: Satisfied**
  - CS 100A (Data Structures and Algorithms)
  - EE 50 (Fundamentals of Electronics)
   
- **Core Requirements: Satisfied**
  - CS 200 (Operating System Concepts → CS 107 equivalent)
  - CS 210 (Introduction to AI → CS 221 equivalent)
  - CS 106C (Data Structures and Algorithms)

- **Depth Requirements: Partially Satisfied**
  - CS 210 (AI Principles)
  - CS 250 (Advanced Algorithms)
  - CS 099 or equivalents (requires verification which areas they cover)
  - CS 260 (Machine Learning)
  
- **Senior Project: Satisfied**
  - CS 199 (AI Capstone Project)

### BS Degree Summary
- Overall GPA: Satisfied (3.115 on a 4.0 scale, requirement 2.0 minimum)
- **Missing Requirements**:
  - Technology in Society requirement (1 course)
  - PHYS 43 or equivalent for Science Requirements
  
Given the above analysis, the student would require:
- At least one course from the Technology in Society approved list.
- PHYS 43 or a substitute acceptable under the science requirements.

**Output for BS**:
```
Missing Requirements:
- Technology in Society requirement
- PHYS 43 or equivalent
```

### MS Specialization Requirements
1. **Foundations Requirement: Essential Computer Science courses**
   - CS103, CS109 (or equivalent)
   - CS161, CS107 (or CS107E), CS110 (or CS111)

2. **Significant Implementation Requirement**
   - One course from an approved list with significant implementation: CS 140, 212, 221, etc.
   
3. **Breadth Requirement**
   - Three courses from different areas (A, B, C, D)

4. **Artificial Intelligence Depth Requirement**
   - CS 221 required
   - At least four from the lists provided
   - Total of at least 21 units from depth courses

5. **Electives**
   - Additional courses to meet total 45 units needed

### Transcript Analysis for MS Requirements
- **Foundations Requirement: Partially Satisfied**
  - CS103, CS109, CS107, CS111, CS161 (already verified through BS)
  
- **Significant Implementation Requirement: Not Verified**
  - Specific course needs identification for implementation requirement
  
- **Breadth Requirement: Not Verified**
  - Needs specific courses from three distinct areas

- **Artificial Intelligence Depth Requirement: Partially Satisfied**
  - CS 210 (AI Principles)
  - CS 260 (Machine Learning)
  
- **Electives: Partially Satisfied**
  - Current graduate courses in transcript need to be verified

**Output for MS**:
```
Missing Requirements:
- Significant Implementation requirement course
- Three breadth area courses (from different areas)
- Additional electives to meet total 45 units needed
```
