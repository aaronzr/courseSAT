Rule1: If at least one animal hides her cards from the owl, then the bulldog unites with the stork. Rule2: Regarding the bulldog, if it is in Canada at the moment, then we can conclude that it does not invest in the company whose owner is the camel. Rule3: The bulldog will invest in the company owned by the camel if it (the bulldog) has a basketball that fits in a 22.8 x 26.2 x 23.1 inches box.

And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: Regarding the owl, if it works in marketing, then we can conclude that it negotiates a deal with the seahorse. Rule2: If you are positive that you saw one of the animals negotiates a deal with the seahorse, you can be certain that it will not stop the victory of the dove. Rule3: Here is an important piece of information about the butterfly: if it has more money than the chinchilla then it does not refuse to help the owl for sure. Rule4: If something invests in the company whose owner is the rhino, then it disarms the otter, too. Rule5: If there is evidence that one animal, no matter which one, disarms the otter, then the owl stops the victory of the dove undoubtedly. Rule6: For the owl, if the belief is that the butterfly disarms the owl and the bulldog does not fall on a square that belongs to the owl, then you can add \"the owl does not smile at the fish\" to your conclusions. Rule7: The living creature that suspects the truthfulness of the cougar will also stop the victory of the owl, without a doubt. Rule8: From observing that an animal does not refuse to help the pelikan, one can conclude that it falls on a square that belongs to the owl. Rule9: There exists an animal which swears to the dinosaur? Then the butterfly definitely refuses to help the owl. Rule10: If the mule does not hide the cards that she has from the bulldog, then the bulldog does not fall on a square of the owl. Rule11: The worm will not disarm the otter, in the case where the gadwall does not trade one of its pieces with the worm. Rule12: Be careful when something stops the victory of the dove and also leaves the houses occupied by the badger because in this case it will surely smile at the fish (this may or may not be problematic). Rule13: If there is evidence that one animal, no matter which one, pays some $$$ to the monkey, then the mule is not going to hide her cards from the bulldog.
